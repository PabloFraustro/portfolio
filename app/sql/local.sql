I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, another WordCamp Europe is in the books. We had the second-highest number of tickets sold in the history of our event series, with the first being WordCamp Europe in Berlin. But even with that number of tickets sold, that number of people gathering together to talk about WordPress and related things, there were still a lot of people who didn&#8217;t get to join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For some, that came with experiencing FOMO, but some of you embraced the JOMO of it all. Either way, at this point, there are a good collection of wrap-ups and round-ups going around, so I&#8217;m here to tell you a bit about what was buzzing in the hallway track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, everyone was so excited to see old friends and make new ones. Everywhere I turned, I saw WordPressers in clusters catching up, most included new to the crew faces. So we know that we were using the Pac-Man rule that we love so much. But even while they were catching up on the last two, three, four years, they were also talking to each other about how to get more folks to things like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we all generally agree that your first time meeting other WordPressers can be a truly pivotal moment in your WordPress journey, it was a delight to hear so much brainstorming focused on that. From mentorship to community introduction and the future of our events, the question of how to keep our ecosystem healthy and thriving was a big topic. Does any one of us have all the answers to this? No, but fortunately, we&#8217;ve got a global set of thinkers working on this global question. So, together, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with some good guesses to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Secondly, I saw a ton of talks and discussions about career development, not only about how to learn more but also how to be a champion for open source in your company, how to advocate for contribution as a best business practice. And what other communities can teach us about how they commit to their user&#8217;s continuing education, for lack of a friendlier term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy, do I love a good conversation about how to make working in open source easier, make it more meaningful, and more impactful. I&#8217;m in favor of anything that helps to dignify our profession. The front-facing, easy-to-use experience of WordPress, in particular, has been misunderstood to mean that we are a simple piece of software for simple tasks. And that is the way with our mission really. If we succeed at democratizing publishing or learning or commerce for that matter, we are taking the arcane and making it mundane. But simple to use doesn&#8217;t mean simple to create. And I want all of our future employers and clients to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing that I saw lighting up the hallway track was the idea of bringing life and excitement back to the web. WordPress has been fighting against closed systems for a long time, but as Matt alluded to in his keynote, merely having an open web is still not quite as fun as having an active and dynamic one. And we saw that both in general desire to bring fun back to being online, but also in the fresh variety of demos and workshops that we saw in the fun that was brought to the event. There were new and shocking implementations of Playground, I must say. Which, as far as I can tell, will basically be able to run everything one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But at WordCamp Europe, it ran; it powered our second massive hybrid translation event, where we translated something like 50,000 strings. We also had an amazing speed-building duel with an accepted future challenge between Jessica Lyschik and Matt Mullenweg. And not for nothing; the way we designed; the way the event area was put together included ways to stop and just have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a little grassy area with yard games and smaller pods of chairs for those quick hallway catch-ups that you just don&#8217;t get anywhere else. And for me, it was simply lovely to see everyone embracing the fun that was there, but also hearing about how much they wanted to help the web embrace the fun that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Thanks for listening to my hallway track recap. Hopefully, it caused JOMO, not FOMO. And now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First thing on my list is WordPress 6.6 update. So we are reaching the release candidate phase tomorrow. WordPress 6.6 RC1 will be released, so download and join the community helping us to get this release out the door. It is scheduled for July 16th. If you have plugins or themes or any sort of business that uses WordPress, now is the time to get in and test it on a test site. I don&#8217;t recommend putting it in production at any point, but come and test it. Help us break it so that we can make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break for other people, for the, you know, 43% of the web that uses it when we get it out the door on the 16th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is that we have a WordPress Project Contributor Handbook V2 out there. It aims to be the quintessential resource for everyone in our community. And it will provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of where to find key information and different aspects of our community. How it all kind of connects together. And, just like a release, we really need some feedback from you. There is the repo on GitHub where you can go and kind of make inline comments, join the discussion about it. It can be a go-to resource if we look at it together and make sure that it has as much information as clearly stated as you wished you had when you were learning your way around WordPress for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on the list is actually another handbook. So, the Sustainability Team has put together a handbook specifically for events. It&#8217;s their first version, and over the past few months, members of that team have been sharing their ideas and experiences on how WordPress community events can be held more sustainably. All this input created a first draft, which eventually became this first version. And so we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, wander over there, take a look at it, see what some best practices for sustainable events are in the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on my list is about WordCamp US. I realize this is a podcast about WordCamp Europe right now. And so it&#8217;s odd to think that I&#8217;m moving right along into WordCamp US. However, there is a deadline coming up. July 1st is the last day to sign up to be a volunteer at this event. It&#8217;s taking place this year in Portland, Oregon, on the west side of the US. And it should be a really fun time. It&#8217;s middle of September. Come on out there. Learn about WordPress. Learn about contribution. Maybe get some voodoo donuts. You know, the important things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> A pivotal moment in my WordPress journey was when someone invited me to a WordCamp. I was sort of aware of WordPress, but certainly not aware of the community or the ways of open source. And when I look back, there were a few things I wish I had known going in. I am, of course, an unapologetic extrovert and therefore unstoppable at events, but if you are headed to your first WordCamp and are feeling a little nervous or confused, then pop in some earbuds because the next 10 minutes are for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We&#8217;re going to first take a look at some basic tactical things about WordCamps, and then I&#8217;m going to tell you a few, like, human things about being a human going to events. If you&#8217;re a dog going to these events, I think that your prep is different, but also that is not my area of expertise. So the first thing, some tactical stuff about going to WordCamps. All of this happens before you even get in the front door. And so this is stuff that you can do in the comfort of your own home, on your own time, using your own computer. If you&#8217;ve got questions, you&#8217;ve got a search engine nearby to take some quick searches. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things first, the shape of a WordCamp. All WordCamps have at least one day of talks, one social event, and sponsors to connect to. Some also have extra events that you need to sign up for, like Contributor Days, workshops, things like that. But we&#8217;ll start with the main event, right? We&#8217;re going to start with the day of talks and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So when we&#8217;re looking at the main event of a WordCamp, what you should do is you should head to the WordCamp&#8217;s website and check out the schedule. I suggest that you plan for two, maybe three things that you might want to learn and look around at the schedule to see if there are any presenters or presentations that look like they fit those things that you think you might want to learn. Because if it&#8217;s not working for you, if it&#8217;s not teaching you something, then you don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in that one. Even if you&#8217;re not sure about a session a talk that you&#8217;re planning to go to, I recommend that you stop by, and then if you find out that it&#8217;s not for you, you can leave again.  That&#8217;s fine. But I do encourage you to go to at least one thing that feels a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feel lost right now. It at least gives you an idea of what to search for once you do get to that point. I would never have known the things to search for early on in my learning of WordPress without going to at least one or two sessions that were just way over my head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing is don&#8217;t forget to check when lunch is available. And if you have dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time. I realize this sounds silly, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t focus when I&#8217;m hungry. But also, it&#8217;s really a great, low-stakes networking time, and I think one of the overlooked networking times as well. I mean, everyone&#8217;s gotta eat, right? And it&#8217;s easier to strike up a conversation over a meal than just out of thin air or, you know, in the middle of a presentation when you&#8217;re supposed to be listening to a talk. So yeah, check out when lunch is happening! And yeah, make a friend or two, sit down at a table, and ask somebody what they&#8217;re doing with WordPress and how long they&#8217;ve been doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing that I would recommend that you do when you&#8217;re looking at kind of the main event for a WordCamp is to schedule in time to wander around and meet the event sponsors. They are all experts in some WordPress problem or other, so probably they have a solution to a problem that you have got. But they&#8217;re also how we keep our prices super low, so even if you have no problems or you think you have no problems. Still, check them out. They&#8217;re also staffed with wonderful people that are building really cool stuff with WordPress and so you might just get some inspiration out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now for the side events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the side events, we&#8217;re going to kind of start close to the main event and work our way out. So you&#8217;ve got generally three types of side events if you don&#8217;t count the networking things, which, in this case, I&#8217;m not. But just know that almost every WordCamp has some networking event, either an after-party or, like, a happy hour, a social that happens before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll get emails about those if you have signed up for updates on the website. Also, you can look on the website directly. Just check out the schedule. Always go to those. The networking is the best at a WordCamp. But the side events—we&#8217;re talking about specific types. Like I said, we&#8217;re going to start close and work our way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, workshops. These are just what they sound like. They&#8217;re classroom-style opportunities to practice the things you&#8217;ve learned at meetup events or on learn.WordPress.org, depending on how you found your way to this WordCamp. They mostly happen during the WordCamp itself. in a separate track, and there are like stacks of workshops in that track in that series of sessions. But a lot of them do require preregistration simply so that the trainer has an idea of how many people to expect. Again, if you get in the workshop and it&#8217;s way over your head, you feel like you absolutely cannot get it done, you&#8217;re always welcome to leave and check out some other area. But, in general, the workshops that we have WordCamps are pretty solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a little bit further removed from that are our Youth and Teen Days. So this is more of an event series that is specifically designed for teens or kids who are trying to learn more about WordPress and other related business and entrepreneurial topics. It&#8217;s kind of a catch all but also has a lot of WordPress content in it. They have age limits, of course, and require separate registration for safety and planning purposes both. And those, in general, are either half-day during the WordCamp itself or a full-day during that WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us then to the big one, the major side event. This is a full-day side event called Contributor Day. If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, it will happen either the day before or the day after the WordCamp itself. It is an entire day where attendees come together to learn how to contribute to the future of the WordPress open source project. Now, if you are listening to this as part of, like, you&#8217;re getting ready to go to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what I meant by open source or open source project or WordPress open source project, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You&#8217;re going to learn all about it at the Contributor Day if you go, but the TLDR is that this software that you are about to choose to build your website on is built by thousands of people across the planet who are looking for the best solutions to problems that they have in their businesses that probably you will encounter or have encountered before. There&#8217;s no new problems under the sun, and open source methodologies kind of use the collective wisdom of everybody who has ever worked with a WordPress project or site and ran into a problem that they had to solve on their own, like this open source project, this community of people just make sure that that wisdom is collected and standardized and made available for all of eternity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. Low key. I&#8217;ve made Contributor Days sound so calming. However, that is a whole day thing. It happens before or after the WordCamp. It has separate registration so that organizers of your WordCamp can plan for how many folks need to be there to teach new and returning contributors, what to do. If I&#8217;m going to be honest, if you&#8217;re going to get overwhelmed at any WordPress event, it&#8217;s going to be one of these, but they are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Even if you just make a single contribution and never return, which I hope is not the case for you. I hope you do return. Even if you make a single contribution and never return, there&#8217;s something really grounding about seeing how much expertise and time, and care goes into this software that is, against all odds, completely free. So that&#8217;s all the tactical stuff, or a lot of it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It at least gives you a sense for what you&#8217;re getting yourself into for your first-ever wonderful WordPress weekend. But I promised you some human stuff too. So here is my considerably shorter list of stuff to bring as a human being going to a WordCamp. There&#8217;s an optional one. I&#8217;ll start you off with an optional one. Come with an idea of what you think you want to learn. You don&#8217;t have to come with that if you don&#8217;t want to. Some of us don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know yet, and that&#8217;s fine too. But if you have a sense for what you think you need to learn, you&#8217;ll have an easier time figuring out how to spend your time while you&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the non-optional things. Bring some way to exchange information. It can be QR codes, business cards, or pen and paper. It doesn&#8217;t really matter as long as it&#8217;s something that works for you to be sharing information with people that you meet. Because you never know when you&#8217;re going to meet your business soulmate, but the odds that you&#8217;re going to do it at a WordCamp are pretty dang high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to bring is bring what you need to be comfortable. Bring your water bottle, a change of shoes if you need it, spare battery for your phone, your glasses. This day is going to be long enough without worrying about small inconveniences. So bring what you need to make yourself comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And finally bring your bravery. You will not know by looking at someone whether they&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for two years or two weeks. But you can know that at some point, they were in the first two days of trying to figure this all out. One of the most endearing things about this community is the zeal they bring to solving a problem. So if you get lost or stuck, just ask the person next to you. We all remember what it was like to know nothing, and we are rooting for you to succeed. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s your whole list. That&#8217;s everything you need to know to be the most prepared first-time attendee to a WordCamp ever. If that all sounded more overwhelming than just showing up, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also just show up. That&#8217;s what I did. And even though I knew next to nothing, those WordCampers made me feel welcome and included and kept me coming back to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Ah, WordCamps. Gosh, I love those things. So glad that we&#8217;re all getting back together for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] (Music interlude) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now, my friends, to our small list of big things. If you&#8217;re a first-time WordPresser, if you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what any of these things are, don&#8217;t worry; you can still go take a look at them, or you can wait until later when you&#8217;re less overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, but this is our small list of big things for middle of the year 2024. First thing on my list, the gender equality in WordPress businesses survey is still open. It aims to gain critical insight into the gender composition of leadership teams, the experiences of women and gender-diverse leaders and employees, and also take a look at the challenges and barriers to their career success. I care deeply about making sure that we have a way for folks who are traditionally and historically underrepresented in technology have a way to get into our space. Obviously, women and nonbinary folks are an area that I feel particularly called to help build those on-ramps for, but I have a great concern for that across the entire ecosystem and any intersection that we run into as we get more and more users into our space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you are a woman, if you work with women, if you work in WordPress, if you work in a WordPress business, go take that survey, and let&#8217;s see what we find out about what it&#8217;s like to work in this space, as somebody that we normally don&#8217;t see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordCamp Asia 2025 dates and venue have been revealed. So WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2024 were both major successes, and we are excited to share that the dates and venue for next year will be February 20th, 21st, 22nd in 2025 in Manila, and you&#8217;ll be able to go over to that website, take a look at it, we&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes as always and maybe start planning your your next big Asian adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on my list is this new contributor wizard questionnaire. So, there are more than 20 teams to contribute to in the WordPress project. They all show up at those Contributor Days that I talked about. But there are more than 20 of them. They work on different parts of the WordPress project every day. And our passionate community offers contribution opportunities for everyone. I know, we know, that finding the right team is the key to a meaningful contributor experience. So, our interactive questionnaire is here to help you determine where to start. It is sometimes difficult to know whether you can contribute to a software if you are a designer, if you are a writer, if you are in marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can contribute to WordPress with a bunch of skills that you otherwise would not have realized. So, we&#8217;ll have a link to the questionnaire in the show notes again. Also, it&#8217;s probably going to pop up on WordCamp sites, Contributor Day sites, anything that helps you all understand where you might find a little bit of success as a contributor is a good place for it to be. Take the questionnaire, see where you land, the WordPress sorting hat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number four. So we&#8217;ve made some updates, not we&#8217;ve made some updates, we have some updates from the Five for the Future program. So the Five for the Future program has a long history in the WordPress project. There are a couple of different episodes in this podcast where you can learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, to bolster transparency and openness, we have an update on the current state of WordPress contributions as of the end of May 2024. In the past few months, we&#8217;ve made a lot of efforts to improve the program and contributor experience in WordPress. We&#8217;ve also done a little bit of work to kind of clean up the pledges that are in there for, people or companies or teams that have found that they couldn&#8217;t continue their contributions over time. That is fine too. But we&#8217;ll have a link to that update in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode. If you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I am your host, Josepha Haden Chomposy. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:36] (Music outro) </p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"17352\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"WordPress 6.5.4 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-5-4-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 15:57:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17340\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:345:\"WordPress 6.5.4 is now available!This minor release features 5 bug fixes in Core.

Please follow the project&#8217;s responsible-disclosure practices detailed on this <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s coming to WordPress 6.6?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s second major release is about polish and finesse. Features that landed in the last few releases have new flexibility and smoother flows—and a few new tricks. And of course there are a few brand-new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Views updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the groundwork for phase 3, Data Views get new and improved experience of working with information in the Site Editor. A new layout consolidates patterns and template parts, gets you to general management views in fewer clicks, and packs in a wide range of refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overrides in synced patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could keep a synced pattern‘s <em>look and feel</em> everywhere it appears—keeping it on brand—but have different <em>content</em> everywhere it appears?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, maybe you‘re building a pattern for recipes. Ideally, you want to keep the overall design of the recipe card consistent on every post that will have a recipe. But the recipe itself—the ingredients, the steps, special notes on technique—will be different every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And perhaps, in the future, other people might need to change the design of the recipe pattern. It would be nice to know they can do that, and that the content in existing recipes will stay right where it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In version 6.6, you can make all that happen, and overrides in synced patterns are the way you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See all the blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to now, when you had a block selected and then opened the block Inserter, you only saw the blocks you were allowed to add to your selected block. Where were all the others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.6, when you have a block selected, you get two lists. First, there&#8217;s the list of blocks you can insert at your selected block. Then you get a list with all the other blocks. So you can get an idea of what you can use in your selected block, and what other blocks you could use in another area. In fact, if you select a block from that second list, WordPress 6.6 will add it below your block, to use in whatever you build next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A new publish flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.6 brings the post and site editors closer together than ever. So whether you’re writing for a post in the post editor or a page in the Site Editor, your experience will be about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Style variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a block theme comes with style variations, 6.6 vastly expands your design options right out of the box, without installing or configuring a single thing. Because in 6.6, your theme  pulls the color palettes and typography style sets out of its installed variations to let you mix and match for a whole world of expanded creative expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Section styles </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you build themes? Now you can define style options for separate sections of multiple blocks, including inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then your users can apply those block style variations to entire groups of blocks, effectively creating branded sections they can curate across a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A note about CSS specificity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier for your variations to override the global styles CSS, those styles now come wrapped in `:root`. That limits their specificity. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/61810\">For details, read the full discussion on GitHub.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A native Grid layout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grid is a new variation for the Group block that lets you arrange the blocks inside it as a grid. If you&#8217;ve been using a plugin for this, now you can make your grids natively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better pattern management in Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard right: You can do everything with patterns in Classic themes that you can in a block theme. You can see all the patterns available to you in a single view and insert a pattern on the fly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negative. Margins.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re here: negative margin values, so you can make objects overlap in your design. As a guardrail, you can only set a negative margin by typing an actual negative number, not by using the slider. That’s to keep people from adding negative values they didn&#8217;t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rollback auto-updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can have the convenience of setting all your plugins to auto-update and the inner peace you get from knowing that if anything goes wrong, 6.6 will do a rollback. Automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This post <strong><em>reflects the latest changes</em></strong> as of June 4, 2024.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Again, the features in this first beta

I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40]&nbsp;<strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, another WordCamp Europe is in the books. We had the second-highest number of tickets sold in the history of our event series, with the first being WordCamp Europe in Berlin. But even with that number of tickets sold, that number of people gathering together to talk about WordPress and related things, there were still a lot of people who didn&#8217;t get to join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> For some, that came with experiencing FOMO, but some of you embraced the JOMO of it all. Either way, at this point, there are a good collection of wrap-ups and round-ups going around, so I&#8217;m here to tell you a bit about what was buzzing in the hallway track.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, everyone was so excited to see old friends and make new ones. Everywhere I turned, I saw WordPressers in clusters catching up, most included new to the crew faces. So we know that we were using the Pac-Man rule that we love so much. But even while they were catching up on the last two, three, four years, they were also talking to each other about how to get more folks to things like this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we all generally agree that your first time meeting other WordPressers can be a truly pivotal moment in your WordPress journey, it was a delight to hear so much brainstorming focused on that. From mentorship to community introduction and the future of our events, the question of how to keep our ecosystem healthy and thriving was a big topic. Does any one of us have all the answers to this? No, but fortunately, we&#8217;ve got a global set of thinkers working on this global question. So, together, I&#8217;m sure we can come up with some good guesses to try out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:21] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Secondly, I saw a ton of talks and discussions about career development, not only about how to learn more but also how to be a champion for open source in your company, how to advocate for contribution as a best business practice. And what other communities can teach us about how they commit to their user&#8217;s continuing education, for lack of a friendlier term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And boy, do I love a good conversation about how to make working in open source easier, make it more meaningful, and more impactful. I&#8217;m in favor of anything that helps to dignify our profession. The front-facing, easy-to-use experience of WordPress, in particular, has been misunderstood to mean that we are a simple piece of software for simple tasks. And that is the way with our mission really. If we succeed at democratizing publishing or learning or commerce for that matter, we are taking the arcane and making it mundane. But simple to use doesn&#8217;t mean simple to create. And I want all of our future employers and clients to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:24] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing that I saw lighting up the hallway track was the idea of bringing life and excitement back to the web. WordPress has been fighting against closed systems for a long time, but as Matt alluded to in his keynote, merely having an open web is still not quite as fun as having an active and dynamic one. And we saw that both in general desire to bring fun back to being online, but also in the fresh variety of demos and workshops that we saw in the fun that was brought to the event. There were new and shocking implementations of Playground, I must say. Which, as far as I can tell, will basically be able to run everything one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:03] <strong>Josepha:</strong> But at WordCamp Europe, it ran; it powered our second massive hybrid translation event, where we translated something like 50,000 strings. We also had an amazing speed-building duel with an accepted future challenge between Jessica Lyschik and Matt Mullenweg. And not for nothing; the way we designed; the way the event area was put together included ways to stop and just have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a little grassy area with yard games and smaller pods of chairs for those quick hallway catch-ups that you just don&#8217;t get anywhere else. And for me, it was simply lovely to see everyone embracing the fun that was there, but also hearing about how much they wanted to help the web embrace the fun that could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:48] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:55] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Thanks for listening to my hallway track recap. Hopefully, it caused JOMO, not FOMO. And now, let&#8217;s turn our attention to the small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> First thing on my list is WordPress 6.6 update. So we are reaching the release candidate phase tomorrow. WordPress 6.6 RC1 will be released, so download and join the community helping us to get this release out the door. It is scheduled for July 16th. If you have plugins or themes or any sort of business that uses WordPress, now is the time to get in and test it on a test site. I don&#8217;t recommend putting it in production at any point, but come and test it. Help us break it so that we can make sure that it doesn&#8217;t break for other people, for the, you know, 43% of the web that uses it when we get it out the door on the 16th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is that we have a WordPress Project Contributor Handbook V2 out there. It aims to be the quintessential resource for everyone in our community. And it will provide a bird&#8217;s eye view of where to find key information and different aspects of our community. How it all kind of connects together. And, just like a release, we really need some feedback from you. There is the repo on GitHub where you can go and kind of make inline comments, join the discussion about it. It can be a go-to resource if we look at it together and make sure that it has as much information as clearly stated as you wished you had when you were learning your way around WordPress for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:27] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on the list is actually another handbook. So, the Sustainability Team has put together a handbook specifically for events. It&#8217;s their first version, and over the past few months, members of that team have been sharing their ideas and experiences on how WordPress community events can be held more sustainably. All this input created a first draft, which eventually became this first version. And so we&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, wander over there, take a look at it, see what some best practices for sustainable events are in the WordPress ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on my list is about WordCamp US. I realize this is a podcast about WordCamp Europe right now. And so it&#8217;s odd to think that I&#8217;m moving right along into WordCamp US. However, there is a deadline coming up. July 1st is the last day to sign up to be a volunteer at this event. It&#8217;s taking place this year in Portland, Oregon, on the west side of the US. And it should be a really fun time. It&#8217;s middle of September. Come on out there. Learn about WordPress. Learn about contribution. Maybe get some voodoo donuts. You know, the important things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordCamp Europe, WordPress 6.6, Gutenberg 18.6. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at Gutenberg Times, and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source Project sponsored by Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future program. As co-host, I&#8217;m thrilled to have again Jessica Lyschick with me. She is a Front end and WordPress Developer at GREYD, co-lead of development of Twenty Twenty Four theme, and was the co-lead organizer of WordCamp Germany last year. We both just returned from WordCamp Europe in Torino. Welcome to the show again, Jessica, how are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Well, I&#8217;m good. I finally got some much needed rest the past couple of days. Some extra sleep because you do not get that during Wordcamp Europe as always, or any WordCamp. Yeah, but I&#8217;m doing good. Glad that you have me on the show again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I had the same thing. It took me about a day and a half to really recover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Monday was hard. Monday was hard. It was like, &#8220;Ugh, I don&#8217;t want to get up at all.&#8221; But I had to go grocery shopping because the fridge was empty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So in that case Lieferando is also a good place to get food delivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Oh, I did have sushi in the evening, so I did not cook on Monday at all. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;No, not today.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordCamp Europe</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I hear you. I hear you. So one of my takeaways from WordCamp Europe is that Jessica is one of the most courageous people I know. Not only did you prepare a presentation on the Twenty Twenty Four theme pushing default themes forward, you also participated in a live onstage speed building challenge against Rich Tabor. And then during Q&amp;A, you challenged Matt Mullenweg to also participate in one. So let&#8217;s talk about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On this show, we talk quite a bit about the Twenty Twenty Four theme and appeared with you as also with Maggie Cabrera. So we covered how versatile it is and also about the kudos it received around the community, so contract relations. And in the post on the Gutenberg Times, seven talks about block themes and beyond at WordCamp Europe. The talk is listed, your talk is listed. Including a link for the recording. So if you don&#8217;t know dear listeners, much about Twenty Twenty Four or the nature of open nature of default themes, that&#8217;s a great talk to watch on the rerun. So let&#8217;s talk about the speed building challenge, Jessica.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> For those listeners who don&#8217;t know, Jamie Marsland, a longtime WordPress educator and YouTuber invented a format and invited WebPress community members to recreate sites on his YouTube channel. I&#8217;ll share a playlist of the five that were already done in the show notes, but you can see Rich Tabor, Justin Tadlock, Nick Diego, and others competing with fellows from the page builder community. I&#8217;m sure Jessica, you also noticed that they&#8217;re all dudes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: Except for one. There was, I think it was Kim Coleman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, right. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Was in the second one, but that&#8217;s what I complained to Jamie. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;There&#8217;s not so much diversity in your lineup there.&#8221; And then Jamie was like, &#8220;Oh, can you come to work in Europe and do it there?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nice. So you went against Rich Tabor and how did that work out? What did you have to build and how did you go about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: So that was a really fun thing to do. So before we started, Jamie teased us with the Lingscars website. If you don&#8217;t know this one or maybe you have seen it before, lingscars.com, I think is the link. It&#8217;s a very crazy website. It&#8217;s like something from the early &#8217;00s with overstuffed images everywhere and patterns and crazy going on website. Which is like a cognitive nightmare, you could call it maybe. And I saw it already and I was like, &#8220;Oh no, please not this one. Anything but not this one.&#8221; But Jamie was just kidding. So he was trying to tease us there. And then he actually picked a website from the WordPress Rock Showcase, which is for the Noguchi Museum. And at first when you look at it looks like very simple, but it has some interesting details to it. So yeah, that was a great challenge and something definitely doable in 30 minutes as a rough sketch or more detailed sketch depending on how skilled you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. All right, so then how did you start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> So we got first a couple of minutes where we could look at the site ourselves to get the first idea in your head, what blocks do I use for this part or how do I make this part? And I&#8217;m usually someone who starts with the header, so I have to get the header done because otherwise it feels like the site is not really done. And then I moved on to the content and I didn&#8217;t pay so much attention to what Rich was doing because I was so much in my own tunnel and I need to get stuff done. I cannot look over what is he doing. But Jamie interrupted every now and then, so of course you cannot go like, &#8220;Ah, shut up.&#8221; But yeah, that was a really, really fun thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, I can imagine that it was a little bit of a disconcerting because we are all people who are in our bubbles when we work hard, concentrated, and then interruptions are actually setting us back. But Jamie had a different job. He needed to entertain the audience there, yeah. So yeah, it was really interesting to see. But you did very well. So the header that you&#8217;re talking about, there was a sticky header, right? No, there was a sticky column.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>There was a sticky column in there. And I must say we looked at, it was like, &#8220;Oh my God, how I&#8217;m going to do it?&#8221; And then Rich explained it before going into it. I was like, &#8220;Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. I&#8217;m going to do that too.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And that&#8217;s what I really found that watching you and Rich, it taught me a lot how to approach building websites, building themes or websites in the site editor. And that happens with every speed building challenge session that I watched. It&#8217;s a special way of building in public and problem solving in public. The time constraint is added. It&#8217;s an added thrill of course, but to show what&#8217;s possible once one gets over the learning curve because starting out with block themes and site editor, there&#8217;s certainly a learning curve there, yeah. And the difficulty that you encounter needs to be separated vs is that part of my learning process or is it going to be that way when I know how to do it? Is it still difficult? And I think a few people think that the learning process is part of how it&#8217;s always going to be and it never will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re going to get faster and faster, and you both did a great job recreating the website in 30 minutes. But it&#8217;s how fast you can get with a prototype. That was really astonishing for me and the visual idea out of your head. But of course you were all following a site that was already built. So all the discussions with the client beforehand were already done. What&#8217;s the color? What&#8217;s the content, what&#8217;s the image going to look like? But with the site, you can go very fast with your first prototypes and have a conversation started with the client. So this is definitely a good thing to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> And I think it&#8217;s also a good exercise for anyone who wants to try this themselves, especially if you&#8217;re a developer. Because I had this discussion with Collina I think before WordCamp Europe that if you code and are just in the code every day, all day, like I am usually. Using the site editor is so different because it brings you to another level of how do I implement this? How do I recreate visually what I have in my head? So I need to know, okay, I can use this block or that block, this block has this setting or feature I can use there. And I think it&#8217;s also very useful if you go on the other side, on the user side if you will, so you understand, okay, what are people struggling with and how can you make the code or the user experience better so that the users at the end of the day will also have it easier to create something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a very good point. And with WordPress having a set of UI components, I think it&#8217;s really important for a developer to see how they work from a user perspective because that&#8217;s the learned experience that users come to WordPress with. And as a developer you don&#8217;t have to make those decisions anymore on the UI. But sometimes you need to make them, but then you have to decide, okay, where do I part from the WordPress components and build my own components. But I think knowing how far you can push the WordPress components in a user interface is really interesting to see, yeah. So that was the speed building challenge on live stage. So what on earth drove you to challenge Matt during the Q&amp;A to participate in one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Well, sometimes you have these stupid ideas that are just randomly popping up in your head and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Not bad.&#8221; I do have to say though that I did text my colleagues, &#8220;What do you think if I asked Matt this question?&#8221; And immediately I got three replies, &#8220;Do it, do it.&#8221; It was like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks it&#8217;s a good question.&#8221; So I went up to the mic and I intentionally asked the question, not that I am challenging him to do one, but I intentionally said it, &#8220;When are you going to do one without adding me to the part of it?&#8221; So yeah that, maybe you can say escalated quickly into a challenge against Matt positively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Positively. Yeah, it came to an actionable thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yes. And yeah, I&#8217;m going to do it. So I&#8217;m not backing out of this. I mean, I&#8217;ve done one already on a stage in front of a couple hundred people. The room was so full but I didn&#8217;t really notice it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You got into your flow, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: &#8230; got into my flow. And then you ignore the audience. I heard the questions. Sometimes people ask questions specifically, but that&#8217;s like my world ended at my screen during that 30 minutes. I&#8217;ve done it already so I can do it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> To catch up with our listeners. So what happened on stage was Matt said, &#8220;Are you going to be the one I&#8217;m going to do it against? Are you in?&#8221; And Jessica said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And then there was a side note from Matt to Matías Ventura who was sitting in the front row said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to train me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, I don&#8217;t think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And, yeah. After the conversation, was there any back and forth from stage? Was there any conversation afterwards yet about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, nothing in particular. I did meet Matt at the after party for a quick, &#8220;Hi, what was that?&#8221; No, it was very funny. We took a few pictures, his sister took a few pictures of us and I will do a video on my YouTube channel about this fairly soon. Maybe it&#8217;s already out once this podcast is published. If not, you will find that on my YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Excellent, yes. And we definitely share the link to the YouTube channel in the show notes. And well, this comes out Saturday or Sunday. We are recording this on June. What&#8217;s the date? 21st?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> 21st, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> 2024. So it&#8217;ll come out either 23rd or the 24th, so yes. You can also follow along on the summer update by Matt Mullenweg in the show notes with the video to the keynote presentation. But there&#8217;s also a link to the Q&amp;A part of the keynote presentation that&#8217;s always separated out where you can recreate or revisit the exchange between Jessica and Matt. So I haven&#8217;t finished reflecting of WordCamp. Have you any first takeaways that you&#8217;d like to share?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> No, I try to relax this week mostly, to be honest. I did think about a couple things. So first of all, it was an intense week for me as well. We were there with a great team. So that has been a really fun week, hanging out with everyone and WordCamp Europe was, again, so fast, passed by so fast and was so exhausting. But even if it&#8217;s physically and mentally exhausting, it&#8217;s also you always have these positive emotions afterwards because you talk to so many people. You see them, some even just once a year at WordCamp Europe because that&#8217;s the place where you all meet at that time and it&#8217;s just so positive to see everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, having conversations in person, which is so different from even if you do it in Slack or on Twitter or wherever else. So I was also very happy to see that booth of grade was fairly well visited and many people come around and ask what are we doing? What&#8217;s going on? What our next plans are? And also having conversations with other companies&#8217; developers. It&#8217;s like on everyday things. It&#8217;s not just about what are you doing and how can I copy you? Or whatever bad things you might think of. But it&#8217;s a very often very interesting conversations to hear other people&#8217;s point of views and see what are they struggling with, what have they success with? Yeah, overall it was just so much fun again and yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, meeting all the people that you are friends with in the word community, but always mostly see on Slack or in GitHub on issues and PRs and all of a sudden you sit next to them and have coffee and eat with them. And it&#8217;s just almost like a big family reunion. But there were, I think about 70 sponsors there. So I think the WordPress communities is really coming back from what happened in the pandemic, really interesting to support those in-person meetings. And I&#8217;m not done yet, but I think playground is something that I&#8217;m going to play with quite a bit. And it was part of the keynote as well. There was also a talk by Adam Chylinski and he also had a question for Matt about documentation with playground. Yeah, so that&#8217;s certainly one takeaway for me, but I have so many conversations about things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I get them all together into just a list to follow up on things. Yeah, so that&#8217;s about WordCamp Europe. I think there&#8217;s a lot of recap posts coming out of the community. I saw a few from sponsors already, also from community members that were new at WordCamp, I like that. I met quite a few people that were new to WordCamps at all, and they were really amazed on how the community reacted, how they get in contact very quickly with people and have the conversations be around what they care most about. Then that&#8217;s a business and WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So now we get to the announcements that I have for our listeners. If you listen to this over the weekend, there are two events that are happening next week. One is the developer hours, what&#8217;s new for theme developers in WordPress 6.6, that&#8217;s on June 25th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s Justin Tadlock and Nick Diego talking about anything and everything about WordPress 6.64. Block themes, website builders, and maybe also a little bit about plugin developers. If you listen to this episode after June 25th, you can always catch the recording on the YouTube channel of WordPress. There&#8217;s a developer hours playlist where you can also find the one for next week, but also the 24 previous developer hours, just in case you were looking for those. Also, next week, and you can join me, Isabel Bryson and others at the Hallway Hangout. When we explore the grid layouts, that&#8217;s on June 26th, a day later at 11 UTC. The developer hours are on 1500 UTC. But hallway hangouts are 11 UTC, and there will be a short demo of what&#8217;s coming to WordPress 6.6 and what cool layouts you can create with this new grid layout feature. And we also chat about what&#8217;s in the works for the following WordPress releases because the WordPress way is to release fast small version, a minimal viable product kind of thing, and then iterate involving the feedback from users and other developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in contrast to the developer hours that are entail formal presentations, Hallway Hangouts are more like an informal discussions to get feedback from the designers and from the developers and from site builders on what&#8217;s worked on and to see what people think about things. So these are two events for next week. Also, Hallway Hangouts are always recorded and will be shared in a recap post on the make core blog and also in the outreach channel. That&#8217;s fairly, it&#8217;s not new, but there was a FSE outreach experiment, but that was transformed into an official outreach channel where people who are not contributors can come in and ask questions. Ask if something that their experience is wanted or is the right way or if that&#8217;s a bug. That&#8217;s before you actually get your information together to file a bug report, you first need to know is it really a bug? What do other people think? And also if it&#8217;s not clear, if there&#8217;s some confusion. That really helps, those discussions really help inform the developers on what&#8217;s not working right yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And most of the time we put the bug report together and put it together in the GitHub repo. Yeah, that&#8217;s about outreach channel in the WordPress make slack. Come and join us or just come in and if you have a question. That&#8217;s also where we announce the Hallway Hangouts the developer hours, and also share some links from GitHub repo about things that need to be discussion. There&#8217;s also a GitHub team where extenders signed up or are added to it that want to give feedback on work in progress. So Gutenberg developers can then just ping that team and say, &#8220;Well, we need some feedback here. Can you come in?&#8221; And right now there are 20 people in the team, but we can always use more because not everybody has time to answer the ping when it comes because we all have lives and we have work to do. So all right, you are in the group, Jessica? In the outreach group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I&#8217;m in the outreach channel. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m in the team. Probably I&#8217;m in the block themers team. It&#8217;s a different one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s a different one. Yeah, but I can check and would you want to go on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, for sure. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Okay. Yeah, then I&#8217;ll add you to it if you&#8217;re not-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I mean, I&#8217;ve been asking many questions in the outreach channel already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, so you said somebody needs to. You want to return the favor and give feedback on something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: If I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> &#8230; post my 2 cents, why not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah, you have opinions. We&#8217;ll travel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, WordPress 6.6 beta 3 was released this week. And the post lists four different ways you can test the new version and it&#8217;s definitely time to go and make sure your sites plugins and themes are compatible. That&#8217;s always due diligence before a release. And if you do that and you report the bugs that you find. Well, what&#8217;s not working right, there might still be a chance to change it, but the window is closing. I hear rumblings that there will be a silent beta four because there were a few things that still needed another beta. But the release candidate is set for June 25th next week, release candidate one, which stops all development mostly, and one or two bug fixes might get in, but it&#8217;s also the time where the field guide comes out, and that&#8217;s also string freeze. So the translation teams of the 70 to 200 polyglots teams have a chance to translate the new version in their respective languages. So there string freeze, so there&#8217;s probably nothing&#8217;s going to change a lot after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are four ways to test the version, and I think the easiest one is to use playground for it. There&#8217;s a link on it too. And if you use the playground plugin on your own site, you can actually create a sandbox of your current site so you don&#8217;t have to spin up a staging area or locally install and make all the copies and blah, blah, blah. So you install that. It&#8217;s still experimental so it might not work with your site, but if you use it, you can spin up a site and then add the new beta version to the playground and then you can test your site right there. So that&#8217;s definitely a great testing ground for playground. I say playground a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>J<em>essica Lyschik:</em> It happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Have you experimented with playground and how you can use it for your development?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I have researched a bit about it, how we can use it actually for internal stuff at GREYD. An idea we came up with was for support, maybe if you need to quickly spin up a site and make sure that you can recreate this in a complete default state, for example. But that was shortly before WordCamp Europe, so we haven&#8217;t dug into it that much yet. But there are definitely ideas how we can make use of playground to also work within our company with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So I had an interesting conversation just this week with Beatrice Fialo and Sarah Norris. They were showing off the workflow that Autommattic uses for theme development and version control, and they start with Playground, install the Gutenberg plugin and create block theme plugin and then save everything through the create block theme plugin save. Because that allows you to save everything that&#8217;s in the database through the global styles and all the settings into the fire system of a theme. And then connecting playground to GitHub. It automatically uses the changes and creates a pull request on GitHub. And that was really, it&#8217;s almost like magic. I&#8217;m putting together a recap post for that, but that&#8217;s going to be on make core blog. But then the outreach channel, you can already see the videos and the discussion about that. So just a side note about playground and what you can do with it and how mind-boggling that can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s also very interesting. I think. I&#8217;ll have to check that out because we did have some struggles on working with the great theme, when we prepared it for the repository. It&#8217;s like how do you bring those changes that someone makes in the editor inside the patterns, how do you actually bring that into version control? So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely something to check out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, one caveat, create block theme team that creates a block or works on the plugin. They haven&#8217;t integrated patterns yet, so the pattern saving that doesn&#8217;t work yet, but that&#8217;s definitely on the roadmap for one of the future versions, especially after WordPress 6.6 they&#8217;re looking at the sync pattern part. But they also probably need to wait until the core team has a first version about the theme related patterns, sync patterns in themes so they can…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> &#8230; work with that as well, yeah. So there is a little bit of a time delay between what core is doing and then how the create theme block plugin team. Wow, that&#8217;s a muscle. Is catching up with it and working with it. They were ahead on the font library. They were testing the interfaces already in the plugin and then they had to take it out again once the core was having a block library feature in there. But we&#8217;re getting a little sidetracked. I just noticed playground, as I said, playground is what I&#8217;m going to say a lot about. But the dev notes for 6.6 are coming out already in preparation of the field guide, which will be published around, not always exactly when the release candidates publish, but it&#8217;s around next week. I will put in the show notes, the list of the already published dev notes. So we have four of them about the block editor. One is about the side wide images in WebPress 6.6, how you can…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Background images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> What did I say?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> You said only side wide images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Right. Yeah, I forgot the keyword in there. That was the background images in reference 6.6, how you can make it in theme JSON as well as online with a site editor, how you can add it. Also, the grade theme block plugin also saves that into the assets folder if you want to. There is a little feature for that already built in the plugin. Then the next one is about the theme.json version 3 schema, which will be expanded with features from 6.6. There&#8217;s a caveat there. If you are building themes that are used for older versions, don&#8217;t upgrade yet to your theme JSONs yet to version 3 because that only is for WordPress 6 and younger. And I think the dev note, I think it explains that quite a bit. So look at that. And then grid layout type summarizes all the things that come in for grid layout with Drag and Drop, with the Rowspan, Colspan and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we have the unified extensibility APIs in 6.6, that&#8217;s a little cryptic. And the unified word actually refers to unifying post editor and site editor. And the extensibility is about the slot fills or the inspector controls that in the sidebar. And now you can, as a plugin developer, your sidebar items will now also show in the post editor, site editor and template editor. So the only thing you need to do is figure out if you don&#8217;t want them to show in all the three of them, you need to figure out where in the editor experience your users are. So you can switch them on and off. But yeah, Riad has put in a comprehensive dev note about the slot fields that are available and where you find documentation about that. Anything strikes you as really, &#8220;Oh, I need to root this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Oh, I definitely have to check on everything basically. So yeah, I&#8217;m looking forward to the background images. I think this may enhance the overall design process a little bit now that you can, and you do not have to make one group block around everything and then put a background image in there because that&#8217;s already possible. That you can now just define it&#8217;s like what? And do not have add extra blocks to tackle this. Theme.json version 3 is definitely interesting because that was what was I struggling with even during the speed build because of a mistake on my own, but not a big deal at all. I got around it. And yeah, Grid is something I&#8217;ve been looking forward to, so I&#8217;ve been already experimenting with it a bit. So I will definitely come next week to the Hallway Hangout, was it right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> The Hallway Hangout, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, you will see me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And just as a side note, Hallway Hangout is something that tries to recreate the experience in a WordCamp hallway track where you just go from the sessions to the sponsor area and all that and you meet people in the hallway and you start conversations about things. So that&#8217;s the hallway, why we like that so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are also other posts around 6.6 that are not necessarily dev notes for the release. There is a roster of design tools per block. It says it&#8217;s the 6.6 edition, but it&#8217;s a snapshot of all the additions since WordPress 6.6. And it gives you a table of all the core blocks and what they support. Do they support borders? Do they support the background image? Do they support shadows or alignment or typography color? Because not all the design tools are available for all blocks. And it&#8217;s always really hard to, not hard, but it&#8217;s an additional hassle to find out which one it is you put on list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Because sometimes you expect one setting at one block and it&#8217;s not there. And I remember we discussed this probably a year ago or even more, I don&#8217;t know. And I was like, &#8220;Ah, why isn&#8217;t there a list where I can see what&#8217;s available where?&#8221; And there was a list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Now is there…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> So thank you for working on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, you&#8217;re welcome. You&#8217;re welcome. Yeah. It gets me to study the source code of Gutenberg quite a bit on the block.json there to put this together. We are also working on an idea on making that available dynamically so not somebody has to go through all the code and because it&#8217;s already there. Riad had a nice site together that&#8217;s called Block Book as a prototype for that, but he of course didn&#8217;t have the time to pursue it any further. So maybe we&#8217;re going to revive that too, because that took quite a few hours to put together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>I&#8217;m sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Maybe I missed something too. Humans available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> We all make mistakes, no worries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s how I learn. Another post that&#8217;s out there is on the developer blog, that&#8217;s the introduction to the overrides in sync patterns by Nick Diego. And he put a nice introduction together and nice examples on how that works with the block bindings, API, and certainly something to look at. Although it&#8217;s mostly user interfaces, but the custom fields still need to be created and registered in PHP. So it&#8217;s a hybrid thing, but once they&#8217;re there, your users are enabled to assign patterns and to the custom fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third one that I wanted to point out and share in the show notes is the update on the data views by Anne McCarthy. And she just put together a very comprehensive post about what can be used, how you can use it, where the documentation is for, and also where you can follow along and leave feedback. So that&#8217;s certainly interesting for everyone. All right. Oh, I saw a prototype of a notes app for Max that uses Gutenberg outside of WordPress as well as the data components outside of WordPress just in a Mac app. That&#8217;s really cool that those things can happen without WordPress being involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Oh, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah, it&#8217;s bigger than we ever thought it would be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.6</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us to that latest Gutenberg plugin release, 18.6. And I think it&#8217;s always confusing for people to figure out, okay, which feature from the plugin goes into the next release? And the 6.6 release is between Gutenberg plugin release 17.8 to 18.5. So with 18.6, all the new features don&#8217;t go into 6.6. Some of the bug fixes will make it into 6.6 with a certain backport process that the core lead and the core editor leads from the release decide upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancements</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s new in the Gutenberg 16.6? I think the biggest piece for it is that the post content block, quote block and verse block, also getting the background image feature assigned to it. They&#8217;re supported now. So you can add background image and for a quote that&#8217;s really cool because that&#8217;s what you do for social image for instance. So you can put the quote in a block, put a background image there. Take a screenshot and share it on Mastodon or X or Blue Sky or something like that. And it really is cool. The same with verse block for some of our poets and the post content block is the block that is in the loop for…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Or in the templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh, in the templates. Pulling out the content from a post. Of course the background image there shouldn&#8217;t probably it be a whole lot of distractions in there, but that&#8217;s a different story. Yeah, that&#8217;s a design tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> That&#8217;s true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Have you been waiting for this feature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I don&#8217;t think I would need it immediately, but maybe in the future it might become useful. I think the quote blocks one is definitely the one where you or where people will make most use out of it. But for the post content block, I mean you can imagine there might be some very subtle background like small dots or small dashes or something like that. It&#8217;s just giving a texture to it. Maybe an interesting design idea to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I have seen some websites. Not recently though, but it was more in the &#8217;90s and early &#8217;00s where there was a paper background on top.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Oh, yeah. I remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So maybe we get those back. Yeah, it&#8217;s a nostalgic way of thinking going things, yeah. Do you have seen anything in the change log that you wanted to point out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, I think this custom CSS handling to be consistent with block global sites. I did not notice it was inconsistent to be honest. But it&#8217;s a good change that things get aligned and work the same way as other parts of it. Because sometimes it&#8217;s the most frustrating thing when you expect something to work a certain way and it doesn&#8217;t, for whatever reason. There might be historical reasons or nobody thought of it yet. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely an interesting change to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, definitely. Reducing the element of surprise that if something happens you didn&#8217;t expect and then you wonder why on, yeah. It also goes in together with the 18.5 feature that custom CSS styles are persistent through theme changes or style variation changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Style variation, yeah. Oh yeah, that was something I didn&#8217;t even realize before, but then when I thought of it like &#8220;What, why is this happening? Why?&#8221; But I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s now fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s fixed now. And that came from user feedback who were also surprised about a few things. And I think one of the start they&#8217;re like, &#8220;In WordPress, we start small and then iterate on things,&#8221; and sometimes I hear, &#8220;Well, nobody was asked what they think about it. And it started however, three, four months ago,&#8221; and that&#8217;s the place where feedback would&#8217;ve been needed and for the team to move forward or to get input there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New APIs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would point this out that now there is a bootstrap, has nothing to do with the bootstrap on Twitter kind of thing. A basic action extensibility API for the data views for those who want to start working with that. And I quote from the release post, so it&#8217;s very early work. So the very early means inconsistent, not bug free surprise happenings. But the data views is the component that powers some post listing views available in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only post listing but also page listing, pattern listings. In the future it will become an important part of the new admin design project. We all know that is coming. And now there is an API to allow registration of actions for different entities. Could be post types, could be other types of data representation by the listing. And right now the API is private in the Gutenberg plugin and will undergo further development and testing before being made public for third parties. So right now you can only look at it but not use it. Find out more in the pull requests that I will share. And also the recent update for data views we already talked about, but it&#8217;s the time where it starts and where you can read up about it. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s even behind an experiment flag, so we&#8217;ll figure that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bug Fixes<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there was in 18.6, there&#8217;s a ton of bug fixes. One is add custom CSS for block style variation. So block style variation is something that will come to 6.6 or is already in there that you can add additional block styles to custom blocks. And now you can also do custom CSS for that. Cool. In 18.6, so it&#8217;s not going to come to 6.6, did you look at that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik: </em>Yeah, it looks promising that you can add. So it&#8217;s basically adding custom CSS with the CSS property within theme JSON at that specific style variation. We have that for&#8230; I think for regular blocks it&#8217;s already available. I remember there&#8217;s something in Twenty Twenty Four that does exactly that. There&#8217;s just a little CSS snippet somewhere and the theme JSON, and again, I thought this was possible but obviously it was not for style variations. So yeah, that&#8217;s a cool change. So you can even more fine tune style variations if there&#8217;s a setting not existing for that specific CSS property yet. So that&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah, you need a feature in a block that can be done with an animation that can be done with CSS, but it&#8217;s not available through theme.json or through any variables or something like that. Totally get it. So this is really cool. It opens up the editor to a lot of more creativity that is not yet built into the interfaces.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experiments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about experiments, Riad Benguella is one of the lead architect on Gutenberg because the only thing that is not yet in the data views new data views interface is the post management. So when you add a post from the admin top, you get into the block editor. But if you&#8217;re in the menu and click on posts that you don&#8217;t get through the site editor, you always have to go back to the other WP admin menu and go to posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course that needs to migrate into the new design and that is now an experiment that you can switch on in Gutenberg and see what it is. Right now it&#8217;s only a one page and said, have I come to the post management? But that&#8217;s where it&#8217;s going to be in the future. Gutenberg plugin releases to find out how the post dashboard is going to look in there. Again, we start small and these are the beginning of things and there&#8217;s a lot of documentation changes as well, especially for the slot fields that are both editors that we are all put together so they can be linked off in the dev notes. And that&#8217;s pretty much it. I think we are all through the most important things from 18.6 unless you found something that stood out for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Nothing in particular, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s in Active Development or Discussed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Cool. That brings us to two more things and one is that they are in the section of what&#8217;s an active development or what&#8217;s discussed. And I wanted to point people to a proposal about the bits as dynamic tokens by Dennis Snell. He put together a very technical proposal. So the first part of it is very good, explaining what it does. And so when blocks came to the scene, shortcuts were largely abandoned. But shortcuts had its values, have their values and they had many problems but they have value. And part of it is, so there was always a recommendation if you have a short code in your plugin, try to make a block out of it that has a functionality so it&#8217;s much user-friendly because most users don&#8217;t get the square brackets with the attributes and all that. They are not coders. So blocks is definitely a better interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But sometimes you just can&#8217;t use it because it&#8217;s a subscriber&#8217;s name in an email form or it&#8217;s the author display in a query loop template or you want to have that name in a full sentence kind of thing. Or you want to date in a full sentence. So for those, there is no equivalent to short codes yet and this proposal is going to start exploring that bit of it, pun intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, sounds quite interesting. I mean maybe it has a little bit of overlap for the block bindings maybe in some, if you think of it, in some ideas like at the post authors display name in a query loop template. I mean, you can pull that basically from the database. So that would be something interfering with the block bindings feature that we have. So yeah, we have to check out, I think to discuss where are bits going, where are the block bindings going, what is the difference? Because I think even if you haven&#8217;t heard of block bindings yet, this can also be a confusing feature for people. So that&#8217;s definitely interesting to see. I mean, putting in some variables within existing text. That&#8217;s the interesting part of bits actually. So also where you&#8217;re pulling this from. So previously you would have to create a block and then maybe put in some magic to make that happen. And now if you would have a core feature doing that. Sounds great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. So he had a little two paragraph thing, what about block bindings? To answer your thoughts, I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s entirely answered, but bits and block bindings he writes are related, but complimentary systems. Why block bindings can be thought of primarily as a developer oriented API where a developer can open up a given block or a subset of the block attributes to be replaced by some other source of data. Bits are primarily author oriented, giving end users the ability to add source content anywhere. There&#8217;s likely a large overlap in the data sources that power each system. Ideally the registered sources will be compatible with both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> Yeah, sounds good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, if you have any other thoughts, the post is open for comments and there have been quite a few comments already. So that&#8217;s a great discussion to have. Don&#8217;t just read the block, also read the blog post, also read the comments with it so you get a better idea about it. And I shared of course in the show notes. And another thing that&#8217;s being discussed or worked on is, and we mentioned it before, is Sync patterns iteration for WordPress 6.7. So that&#8217;s the next version. And Riad Benguella had a proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is the need that sync patterns are available for theme developers that they can deliver those with their themes and also sync pattern overrides with that. And Riad Benguella, after Dan Danos wrote an iteration, what are the issues that are pattern oriented already in GitHub and what to make of it? There was a discussion among developers and then Riad put together a summary for that and that&#8217;s the comment that I will link to in the show notes where said, so what patterns are and how they should work. And I think it&#8217;s a good summary of what&#8217;s already possible and what needs to work on. So a pattern is always a pattern. It works the same regardless of where it comes from, comes from the theme, does it come from the user, does it come from a template part or something like that? Or does it come from a PHP or from HTML kind of thing. And can be registered with a theme file. Can be registered directly in the database. That&#8217;s the user part, sync to unsync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he has the whole list of what a pattern is and how it functions and what is already existing and what is for the future or later. So I really like this post and he did a great job in putting it all together. Of course the discussion continues, hopefully with your input too. That&#8217;s why we talk about these things that are discussed so you can again be part of the discussion and chime in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is then coming to the end of the show of our 102nd episode. Jessica, thank you so much for being here. Is there anything that you want our listeners to know about and if they want to get in contact with you, how would they do it best?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik</em>: I think that&#8217;s it for today. So I mean I shared a lot about WordCamp Europe and what happened there. We had quite a few interesting topics on what&#8217;s going on in Gutenberg and their development. Yeah, you can find me on Twitter. I always call it&#8217;s still Twitter or it&#8217;s now called X, under my name Jessica Lyschik. Everything will be linked down below, don&#8217;t worry.

I&#8217;ve been used to both, so whatever you prefer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well I&#8217;m going either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jessica Lyschik:</em> I&#8217;m fine with both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Good, thank you.

It references content sourced beyond the post or content in which it’s found. It could refer to metadata about a post, a post&nbsp;meta&nbsp;field, a stock price sourced from an API call, a countdown to a particular date, the local time of a given timestamp in the reader’s timezone, a plugin URL, a view counter, a render for a math formula, or any other bit of knowledge that is provided by the server when rendering a post.&#8221; Snell explained. If I understood the timeline correctly, some foundational work was already committed to Core to be in WordPress 6.6, so this feature can be tested in the next Gutenberg plugin releases.

Some are related to HeroPress, some not.  This one is not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhere around 2017 I went to a WordCamp in Florida.  It was probably Miami. I was a volunteer, and one of the things they asked me to do was be a room monitor at Kids Camp.  Just wander around and answer questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kids were broken up into groups of three. There was one group of three boys, probably 7-9 years old. Two of the boys had long ago given up on computers and were tearing around the room having.a wonderful time as boys that age are wont to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one boy was very intent on his computer. I went over and asked if he needed any help. He looked up at me and said &#8220;Well, I have WooCommerce all set up. and my product configured properly.  Can you show me how to connect it to Stripe?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was surprised to see the progress he made.  I told him that Stripe was something that involved banking information, and he&#8217;d probably need his parents involved.  His face fell and he sat wordlessly staring at his hands in his lap.  I asked if that was a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when he said &#8220;I made this site as a surprise for my Dad.  He lost his job last year, but he has an invention that he made, and he&#8217;s been trying to get it produced so he can support the family with it. I wanted to make an online store for him so that maybe he wouldn&#8217;t cry every night after putting me to bed&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I nearly burst into tears right there, and I can&#8217;t tell this story in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember giving him some advice, but then the day ended, and I never saw him again.  But that story will stick with me forever.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/a-site-for-his-dad/\">A Site For His Dad</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 20:13:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: #124 – Mina Tamang on SEO Techniques That Prioritise the User Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=156399\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/124-mina-tamang-on-seo-techniques-that-prioritise-the-user-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39767:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, putting user experience at the heart of your SEO strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Mina Tamang. Mina works as an SEO expert at Codewing Solutions. She has over six years of experience in the industry. In the past three years, she&#8217;s also become actively involved in the WordPress community, and she recently spoke at WordCamp Katmandu, which is where she lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Mina shares her journey and experiences in SEO, detailing how she discovered her love for the field, and how it has evolved over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a seasoned public speaker with experience in Toastmasters, and she brought her ideas to the stage at WordCamp Asia this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional SEO methods that can sometimes prioritize keyword research to achieve top search engine rankings, Mena champions a user first approach. She explains what she sees as the limitations of outdated practices, and emphasizes the importance of understanding, and addressing the pain points, and needs of your audience. Her central idea is always towards benefiting the end user rather than just appeasing search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the significance of integrating both traditional SEO rules, and user centric content creation, and get into the relevance of technical optimizations, speed factors, and the role of WordPress plugins. For those new to website building, she underscores the user-friendliness of WordPress and its compatibility with her SEO strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s 2024, and so we also discussed the growing influence of AI in content generation. Recognizing its utility, whilst cautioning on the necessity of maintaining a human element to ensure content is relatable and free from in accuracies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to refine your SEO strategies with a focus on longterm, user oriented, growth, whilst also navigating the complexities of modern tools and techniques, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick note before we begin, this is the last live recording from WordCamp Asia. There was quite a lot of background noise to contend with, and I&#8217;d done my best to clean up the audio and make it as easy to listen to as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Mena Tamang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mina Tamang. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:45] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> I&#8217;m doing good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice to have you on the podcast today. You said this is your first podcast appearance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:50] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Are you prepared for your talk at WordCamp Asia? Are you ready to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:55] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So it&#8217;s actually tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:57] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Probably at 10:00 AM. Track four.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And have you done much public speaking in the past?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, I have, I have. Because I&#8217;m engaged with the Toastmasters. So do you know anything about Toastmasters?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:08] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So actually it&#8217;s about making the people learn about the communication skill, as well as leadership skills. And there we also learn about public speaking, so I&#8217;ve done it. Not in the big stage, but smaller stage, but I&#8217;ve done it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So today we&#8217;re going to talk about SEO, and that is what your talk is about at WordCamp Asia. Before we do that, can you just tell us a little bit about your background, where you come from, what organisation you work for? Do you work in the SEO field? So just give us a little biography.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:38] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Sure. So I am Mina Tamang, and I came from the land of Himalayas, so from Nepal. And for the past 6 years I&#8217;ve been doing the SEO, and SEO is like my passion. So I&#8217;ve started from the SEO, and I&#8217;m never thinking of like leaving it. So that&#8217;s what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I work for the Codewing Solution, which is also a WordPress development company, that build WordPress themes, plugins. And I got to know about WordPress more in detail by joining this company, back in I think 2020, during the Covid time. And then I got to learn about the WordPress community. And I saw so many opportunities, and ever since then, I&#8217;ve been engaging with the WordCamps, either by being attendee or by the speakers, and that much more to explore. So yeah, I&#8217;m doing this thing right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, SEO is your day-to-day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:29] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So the talk that you are putting on is all about this different way of doing SEO. You mentioned that there&#8217;s an old way, which obviously you don&#8217;t use, and there&#8217;s a new way. What is the old way, and why do you not do it that way anymore? What is it that&#8217;s wrong with that, and what&#8217;s your new way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:48] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So when I started doing SEO, so what I was taught was, it&#8217;s a search engine optimisation. So we need to rank website on top. Maybe number one. And then it&#8217;ll help to increase traffic on our website. And that will lead to the business success, or whatever the goal is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s what people think still now, and that&#8217;s what I was taught. And that&#8217;s a very vanity things like, what people think and feel about SEO, it&#8217;s all about ranking, and about the traffic. But it&#8217;s not. That&#8217;s the old way of SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, those ranking and those traffic are just numbers. What we need to focus is on the business goal. So let me go more detail. There&#8217;s three types of SEO. There is a black hat SEO, grey hat SEO, and white hat SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we follow all the rules of Google&#8217;s, or any search engines, that&#8217;s a white SEO. And in white SEO we talk about page optimisations, technical optimisations, speed factors, and backlinks, and many more things, content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is a black hat, which is like doing opposite of what you need to be doing. It&#8217;s basically like breaking all the rules and laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a grey hat, the middle part. So mix of the white and the black. So that&#8217;s what people think about SEO. And there are a lot of people who do white, there are a lot of people do black, and the grey, but I&#8217;m not talking about those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I&#8217;m talking about is, the people think that SEO is all about ranking and increase the traffic, but that&#8217;s wrong. Because when you do that, you prioritise the search engine. Let&#8217;s say Google. You are working for Google, not for your audience. And your audience is people, not the bots. So what you need to do is to put your user first. Think about the pain points, and their needs. So if people are searching for how to use, for example, mobile, then selling your phone directly is not your main thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First you need to educate them. How that phone is going to be useful for them in the day-to-day daily uses. So that&#8217;s how you will be dealing with the SEO. So that&#8217;s why I wanted to. And in my new way of doing SEO, my focus is always on the users. So that&#8217;s what wanted to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So if we do things in the old way, and we regard the whole project of SEO of getting to the top of the search ranking, and we want to be number one so that we get discovered more often. The rules for doing that are obvious, well, not obvious, but everybody has slowly learned what those rules are, we&#8217;ve got plugins in WordPress to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does your technique, well, is it easier to do your technique? It certainly sounds more human to do your technique. But, does it have the same impact? If I follow your template, the way that you are going to tell us that you are doing SEO, will I still rise to the top of the search ranking? Because it kind of feels like that&#8217;s always the point. You want to be number one. Does it work, your technique, to get us to number one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:48] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yes. So my point is, we don&#8217;t want to be number one. Because being a number one does not guarantee for your business success, or whatever your metrics is. For example, if I&#8217;m selling a product, and my goal is, or my main target is to sell my product, right? And I&#8217;m ranking on all the keywords that I wanted, but my business success, the metrics, that goal is not happening. So what&#8217;s the point of being number one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can be still in the number one, and also drive the more sales. For that, we need to focus on the users. I&#8217;m not talking about doing all the manual things. We do take help of tools, like plugins. For example, Yoast. But whatever we do, the focus should be done whatever, like, for example, when you do the content creation, if I give you a content that is all written by the AI, and does not meet your pain points, would you converting to my customer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So their needs and the human intellect don&#8217;t necessarily clarify what works for you. For my customers, what are the pain points? So that needs to be done by the human. If it&#8217;s done by the human, they will actually know the pain points. And we&#8217;ll obviously take the help of tools, and plugins, and anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, is it even fair to call this SEO? Because if you&#8217;re not really putting a great deal of thought into the search engine, SEO obviously stands for Search Engine Optimisation, can your system even fairly be called SEO, because you&#8217;re not really giving too much thought about where you&#8217;re going to end up in search?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:16] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay, so let me clarify that. So yes, I&#8217;m obviously working for the SEO. There are certain rules like, when we talk about SEO rules, there&#8217;s a meta title, descriptions, and there are also link, and there also keywords. I&#8217;m not teaching all those things. But whatever I do, I keep in mind the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a time when people used to stuff keywords within a content at massive numbers. That used work. But does that work now? It doesn&#8217;t. So there are certain rules that need to be followed, and we will obviously follow those. But whenever doing the marketing, whether it&#8217;s content through videos or everything, we put the user first. And Google itself put the user first. They want the user to get the useful information from the good website, not from the spammy website, that does everything for the search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there comes the trust factor. So, yes, it&#8217;s called SEO, we do follow all the rules, because I&#8217;m just talking about the content creations, there are other factor as well. When we do the SEO, we also look after the technical things. We have to collaborate with developers, there are changes needed. Okay, this one is not good by looking at the user experience factor, like speed, the designs, everything there is. So we do that as well. And when it comes to doing the content creation, I&#8217;m focusing on that part. So in that sense, we need to put the user first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Give us an example of how you actually do this. So let&#8217;s take the example, you mentioned mobile phones, but we could do anything. You&#8217;re obviously thinking about the purchaser at the end, the customer, the client, whatever it may be. Just talk us through the process that you are going through in your company, to make this all happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:53] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay. So for example, my company sells product, right? So I need to put that, my product, to the audience. People need to know we exist. For that, obviously we will follow all the SEO rules. We need to put the most important keywords within a title, my description within a content, and we will also do the content marketing, video marketing. So then, when we emphasise or highlight the features, we don&#8217;t focus on them, we focus more on the benefits. So, how the product is going to help them. I&#8217;ll give you a simple example, not about a product, but real example. So, do you know about back scratcher?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I can imagine. So something to literally scratch your back with. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:34] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So maybe there was a time it was not discovered, not made, so people used their hands to scratch the back, right? So then they made the product. Now, how did the company sell this? Maybe in those time, there was no internet, or online things to promote things, right? So maybe they sell down the street by showing that back scratcher, doing by themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, how did the audience connect it? Okay, there&#8217;s a thing, like this long thing, a stick that can be used to scratch our back. And they did it with their pain points. There are parts that we can&#8217;t reach with our hand, right? That&#8217;s a simple product in itself. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell. Whenever we do the marketing of our product, we need to emphasise the benefits instead of features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Your process is about choosing the right language, and instead of concentrating relentlessly, which is I think what most people do, on keywords and all of that stuff, you are explaining, and in this case it&#8217;s a product, back scratcher, you are explaining the benefits. And you believe that by just explaining the benefits, you can creep, well, not creep up the search ranking because that isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re trying to do, but you can become discovered because you are using this language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:47] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. And that&#8217;s what I want to focus in is the word of mouth. Because the person, like the product, he is going to obviously tell to his friends, colleague, or anyone that this product is useful. Also I&#8217;m pointing out, and this might not fall under SEO, or beyond the SEO, but it goes along with the SEO, because the SEO doesn&#8217;t fall under the marketing or the sales, it&#8217;s in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we work with sales team as well as marketers, our work is that. So I wanted to focus that word of mouth is a good way of promoting the market. And other thing is we can focus on all the stuff as well. Content, video, and obviously there&#8217;s a backlink, but that also comes with the, there&#8217;s two things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do it by paid, or the free one. Free is organic, it&#8217;s quite difficult to do it. And we also need to consider where the business stands. Is it just in the oldest days of the market? Is it in the mid, or is it in the exploring stage? We also need to consider those things as well. So there are a lot of things to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. When you explain this to your clients, I&#8217;m guessing that most clients will have this notion of, well, no, no, no, we need to use loads of keywords, and we need to ram the keywords in as much as possible, because that&#8217;s the understanding of SEO that they have. Do you get a lot of pushback from your clients when you explain, no, no, no, we&#8217;re not doing any of that, we&#8217;re just going to concentrate on the benefits, and explain them in easy to understand language, and hopefully get discovered. And a bit of word of mouth as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:12] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, a lot, a lot. Because as I said earlier, people think SEO is about keywords, ranking and traffic. So whenever they ask for the report, and we have to tell them, okay, we have this much as traffic, this much conversion, but they want certain keywords to be ranked. And we say them, look, here&#8217;s your report, this is looking good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And SEO is something that does not go at once at all. It&#8217;ll not skyrocket at once, it&#8217;ll take time. So that thing is very difficult to make them understand, that SEO takes time, and ranking for every keyword is not the main goal. Our main goals should be on the business goal, that is to sell the service, product, or anything else that they want us to do. And it&#8217;s very hard, and we need to educate them as well. Look, here my pain point is, they don&#8217;t understand the SEO. What is SEO? And we need to educate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, because I can imagine that, if you&#8217;ve launched a client website, and we&#8217;ll use the example of a back scratcher, if they&#8217;re selling back scratches, within few weeks your customer is going to be going to a search engine, let&#8217;s use the example of Google, and they&#8217;re going to be typing in a whole range of things, they will hit the return key on their computer, and they&#8217;re hoping to see their website on the first page. Number one, number two, number three. They&#8217;re hoping to see that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From what you are saying, you are telling your clients, look, don&#8217;t obsess about that. Stop worrying about becoming first page, number one, number two, whatever it may be. Let&#8217;s concentrate just on making the messaging right. And then if we do that all correctly, it should just follow on that the sales will begin. I&#8217;m guessing that your clients do come to you and say, well, where are we? We&#8217;re not anywhere on the search. I&#8217;m guessing that happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:46] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. So, as I said, when we focus on the benefits and on the users, with time it&#8217;ll automatically rank. So see if we start with the focus on ranking, then that might be a temporary success. It won&#8217;t be the permanent. But if you focus on the user and benefits, with time our website will obviously rank, because there&#8217;s a factor called user experience and the SEO, and that matters a lot for most of the search engine. So ultimately, we will rank as well, and also get the organic, consistent, organic traffic. So that&#8217;s my goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, it sounds like this is a much more simple approach in many ways. It&#8217;s more straightforward, because you&#8217;re not obsessing about, I don&#8217;t know, spreadsheets with all the keywords in, and writing down the numbers of clicks, and all of that. All of that goes out the window, and you&#8217;re just concentrating on easy, straightforward language. And it&#8217;s a long game. You&#8217;re not trying to do this in the next week or month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are saying to your customers, okay, let&#8217;s look at it more over a year, or two years, or something like that. Right, okay. So it&#8217;s a much, much longer game, but easier to do, because really all that you&#8217;re doing is worrying about the language, right? So it&#8217;s easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:51] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, it might be. I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s easier, but we have to be consistent because people might get frustrated about not getting the result. So like there are people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yes, I can imagine they would, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:02] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Especially clients. They worry about, where is the results? Where are we? What are the status about the rankings, traffic? But it takes time, so it&#8217;s for the long run. And we need to be consistently hoping that it will go right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And do the search engines, more and more, take other metrics? So it&#8217;s not just the keywords. You mentioned things like the performance of the website so, you know, we&#8217;ve got things like core web vitals, and all of the bits and pieces that are rolled into that. The speed of the site, obviously the quality of the content itself. There&#8217;s more to the search engine than just keywords. It&#8217;s about the performance, it&#8217;s about the way the site is designed, it&#8217;s about the speed of the server, all of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:41] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. So what Google is trying to do, it&#8217;s trying to help the users by implementing all those factors for all the SEOs and the business owners. What they want is that users get best results from the good website. And for that, all these factors are important, like for the speed. So if your website is not going to load, then people will obviously get frustrated and not get the result, and they have to go from one to another place. And that will obviously take their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when it comes to other content creations, if they are going to website to get information to solve their problems, and they&#8217;re not getting it. So that means, ultimately, Google wants to help its users, and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re implementing all those rules. And all those are just factors. I wouldn&#8217;t say that&#8217;s a ranking factors. People take it as a ranking factor, but when we look after all those things like speed, core web vitals, it doesn&#8217;t have to be perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because when you focus on making all the factors perfect, you might fall into practice of making like your website less useful for users. For example, you&#8217;ve made your core web vitals like a 100% score, but certain features of your website does not load while doing that, which was very important to your audience to engage with their product. Then losses are yours. So we need to mention at least balance. So we need a balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are at a WordPress conference. Are you using WordPress tools? I think you used word Yoast I think a minute ago. So, is your approach based on WordPress plugins that you use, or is this just about using the block editor, creating paragraphs, and writing text which is adjacent to whatever it is that you are trying to market and sell?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:15] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So I am using plugin. WordPress is a lot easier for the beginners. Those people who does not know about anything about technology, about how to build a website, and how to run it. So it&#8217;s quite helpful tool. And I am using it, and I&#8217;m also using for my clients, and for all the people that I tell how to build a website. And it&#8217;s definitely going to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually it&#8217;s not just for the WordPress, it&#8217;s for all the other platform as well. The process, the rules are same for every website. Either it&#8217;s a big, either it&#8217;s small. What&#8217;s it built on? It&#8217;s either the WordPress or Shopify. People call it Shopify SEO. The process, the rules are same. Just we are taking the help of the plugins and the other tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So there&#8217;s no particular plugin that you recommend over another one. WordPress plugins will work for your approach, and you&#8217;re concentrating on the words that you create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:04] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, you can use it. I would definitely recommend using Yoast or Rank Math, for those who don&#8217;t know much about SEO, but don&#8217;t prioritise it to make it a perfect score. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re in the era of AI, and people are making lots and lots of content nowadays with AI. You go to OpenAI, or some other AI, and you ask it to produce a 10,000 word article about back scratchers and it will do it. And will do what looks like a good job. My intuition though is that, it&#8217;s probably not doing you any favors, because the content it creates is maybe not actually very human, or potentially is full of inaccuracies. What are your thoughts on AI created content, and how that might affect your ability to rise into the search results?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:51] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay, so, AI tool is like our arms and legs. It&#8217;s a bit like that for now. And I&#8217;m also using AI tool, but to clarify on my strategy. AI tool can definitely give you whatever you search. Like what is this? It&#8217;ll give you answer. How can I do this? It&#8217;ll give you answer. But what doesn&#8217;t it give you is the personal experiences. And, how do we more connect with the audience naturally? It&#8217;s through the experiences, the learning. So that&#8217;s what I think, in my opinion, lacks the AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m sort of thinking to moving the strategy towards that. Sharing the experience, getting more the personal level. So in that sense, we can obviously, at least do the good SEO without AI tool. I&#8217;m not saying that staying away. I&#8217;m also using AI to create the content. But, for example, you are also using AI tool. I&#8217;m also using AI tools, for the same topic to write a content. It might give you the similar content, right? So now, how am I going to compete with you? We&#8217;ll get the same answer, similar. So that&#8217;s where I do my strategy, the new strategy, of putting my personal experience, and some of my human intellect and critical judgment. That&#8217;s what I do. I will obviously, take the help of AI. I&#8217;m not staying away from it, but I&#8217;m using it in a more creative way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So you are providing additional content, which is, I don&#8217;t know, you&#8217;re teaching people, back scratcher is kind of a difficult example because I don&#8217;t really know that there&#8217;s a lot to say about a back scratcher. But the point is, you are going above and beyond what the AI would just give you. And you are saying be helpful, educate the audience, give them things that they want, you know, give them takeaways, give them things that they can enjoy, give them blog posts that are actually meaningful. So being helpful on your website is the goal, over just pure SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you use AI to search for things these days? So I&#8217;ve really dropped Google as my search engine. I mean, we can go into some of the other search engines that are around there. But I&#8217;m increasingly finding myself using AI to find what I want on the internet. So rather than get me to a particular website, if it&#8217;s a question, I just want the answer to come out. So I go to OpenAI, and I ask it a direct question, and it gives me the answer. So that&#8217;s the other way around. Rather than using AI to create content, do you see that search engines are becoming less visited by people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:14] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> For now, it&#8217;s not. Maybe in the next 2030, I&#8217;m not sure about that. For now, for the short answer that could be answered within like two or three paragraph, people will obviously choose the AI over the search engine. But when it comes to using something like, for example, how to take a photograph, a good photograph, then I might need to check the videos, instead of getting the answers. And they would obviously need a tutorial, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for that, people are still using the search engine, as well as the AI tool. But for the long answer, that needs more tutorial, more of like how to do it, people are using search engine. And for now it&#8217;s okay. I don&#8217;t know about the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the Google is promoting the AI, like there&#8217;s a generative AI. Whatever I will search something, keywords, they will give the answers automatically. But when I have to use any product, how to use it, like if there&#8217;s something problem with my product, any things in my daily life, for example, I crack my phone screen, then how to repair it. Maybe for that I will be using the search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right. Do you concentrate with your clients, do you only talk about Google with your clients? Because I know that there&#8217;s quite a few options out there these days. You know, you&#8217;ve got Bing. There&#8217;s one called Kagi, which I&#8217;ve used quite a few times. I&#8217;ve used Duck Duck Go quite a few times. Is it all about Google? Is Google the thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:31] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> No. So when I talk about search engine, I talk about everything. Though we do mention Google most of the time, because it is the most used search engine, right? So when I say search engine into the non-tech people, they would say Google. So I have to mention it Google. But I haven&#8217;t used other search engine much, like Kagi. I think it&#8217;s a premium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, Kagi you pay for. Duck Duck Go is free though. It&#8217;s ad supported, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:54] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Well, I haven&#8217;t used those, but my priority is not search engine. For example, if I put the Google as a priority search engine, as I said, I would not prioritise more on the search engine, more on the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. So let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m a client, and I come to you, and I&#8217;ve got a shop, and I&#8217;m selling, oh I don&#8217;t know, let&#8217;s say mobile phones. We are going to sit down, and we&#8217;re going to have a conversation about, okay, we want a website, we would like it to be discovered. What are the kind of things that you are telling me to go away and do? You&#8217;ve mentioned videos. You&#8217;ve mentioned things like, well, I&#8217;m guessing blog posts and things like that. What&#8217;s the kind of content that you want me, your client to make, create?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:32] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Okay. So first we need to clarify that SEO is not for every type of website. We need to understand the market, so where the audience is. For the phone, it might be the more of like social media, videos, because people want to see how their phone will look, how it&#8217;ll function, rather than like looking at the text. They would prefer the video, visuals. So we need to understand that as well. So first we need to understand the market, your niche. Then only we could recommend what works best for you. And for the example of phone, it&#8217;s going to be all of them. It&#8217;s also the text, the blogging, the videos, and also the email marketing. Everything will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So let&#8217;s pick a different product then. So not the mobile phone. Let&#8217;s think about, oh I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ve got a bookshop. You know, we&#8217;ve got physical books, people come in to the shop and they buy things from us. It&#8217;s a little bit more of an old technology. You know, maybe there&#8217;s less video in there. So how would that be adapted? Bookshop against mobile phone. What would be the difference that you would be getting customers to think about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:28] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So the audience would obviously be the little bit smaller compared to phone, when it comes to book maybe. For the book, I would recommend to do the social media, blogging, and the email marketing, because people do search books. In my country, in Nepal, there are a lot of books that is very hard to find. And then they need to connect with the bookshop owners frequently. And that&#8217;s where the social media would be much easier to communicate with them faster. So I would recommend the social media instead of, if I have to choose SEO and social media for the book sales shop, I would prefer this social media. So that&#8217;s what I would recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really is a case of talking to the client, and each person that comes through your company&#8217;s door, you have a different set of things that you&#8217;re encouraging them to do. So it may be YouTube videos, it may be it email, it may be blog posts. And depending on what the product is, you are going to get them to make those bits of content specifically based upon the product that they&#8217;ve got. Right, okay. So it seems like it&#8217;s the long game. You&#8217;re in this, and it&#8217;s going to take a year, two years, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s working for your company, this strategy, I&#8217;m guessing. You know, you&#8217;ve got clients coming back, and they&#8217;re seeing, not looking at the search results, but they&#8217;re seeing that their website is effective for them, and they can tell themselves confidently, okay, we paid your company to help us get the products that we&#8217;ve got sold, and it&#8217;s working?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:49] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> So I don&#8217;t do much of client work, because I work for the company, and that have their own product. So actually we sell our own product, and it&#8217;s working good. Actually is all about trial and testing thing. We need to do AB testing a lot. One strategy is working, that might not work for the other websites. We need to do test again and again. So we do the testing things, and it&#8217;s working fine for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone have their own style of working. Even if the rules and the format are the same thing, but I would prefer something else. Like, when I write, create content, I like to put it in the story way. And some other companies might not like it. So there&#8217;s a working style difference, but, yes, it&#8217;s working for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Obviously this is a WordPress podcast that we&#8217;re recording at the moment. Do you use WordPress for all of the sites that you build? Is that part of the company&#8217;s mission, or does this strategy that you&#8217;ve got work with any platform? You know, be that Squarespace, or Wix, or whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:40] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s worked for everyone. It&#8217;s worked for every platform. The SEO is not just for the WordPress. But yes, I am using WordPress and our products is based on WordPress, and all the clients, our customers are all WordPress based. So we do recommend the WordPress plugins, all the things. But it works for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the doing things is different. For the WordPress, we use plugin like Yoast or Rank Math, to do all the SEO stuff. In their platform, for example, Shopify, they might have their own tools or plugins to do that same thing in a different product name. So it&#8217;s the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So what is the company that you work for? Where can we find you? Do you have an email address, or a social handle that you&#8217;d like to share?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:19] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Yeah. I work for the Codewing Solution. You can go and search, it&#8217;s codewing.co. And we are also on social media, Facebook, Instagram, and we also have YouTube channels, and all have dedicated product as well. And those have also the social media handles, and also the websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s all the questions that I&#8217;ve got. Is there anything that you think we&#8217;ve missed, that you&#8217;d to address?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:41] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> I think that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If that&#8217;s the case, I will say thank you very much for chatting to me today, Mina.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"ticss-c8b411f0\">[00:30:46] <strong>Mina Tamang:</strong> Thank you for having me. It was actually a great opportunity to connect with other people, because this is something that I would not get the chance to meet you, and talk with you as well. I definitely grab the opportunity.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Mina Tamang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mina works as an SEO expert at Codewing Solutions. She has over 6 years of experience in the industry. In the past 3 years, she’s also become actively involved in the WordPress community, and she recently spoke at WordCamp Kathmandu which is where she lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, Mina shares her journey and experiences in SEO, detailing how she discovered her love for the field and how it has evolved over time. She&#8217;s a seasoned public speaker with experience in Toastmasters, and she brought her ideas to the stage at WordCamp Asia this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional SEO methods that can sometimes prioritise keyword research to achieve top search engine rankings, Mina champions a user-first approach. She explains what she sees as the limitations of outdated practices and emphasises the importance of understanding and addressing the pain points and needs of your audience. Her central idea is always towards benefitting the end-users rather than just appeasing search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the significance of integrating both traditional SEO rules and user-centric content creation, and get into the relevance of technical optimisations, speed factors, and the role of WordPress plugins. For those new to website building, she underscores the user-friendliness of WordPress and its compatibility with her SEO strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s 2024, and so we also discuss the growing influence of AI in content generation, recognising its utility while cautioning on the necessity of maintaining a human element to ensure content is relatable and free from inaccuracies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to refine your SEO strategies with a focus on long-term, user-oriented growth, while also navigating the complexities of modern tools and techniques, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/\">Toastmasters</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://codewing.co/\">Codewing Solutions</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://yoast.com/\">Yoast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rankmath.com/\">Rank Math</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/en-GB/\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kagi.com/\">Kagi</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/\">DuckDuckGo</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Jun 2024 13:39:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WordPress Foundation: Announcing the 2024 Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship Recipient: Cynthia Norman\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=1186809\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2024/announcing-the-2024-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-recipient-cynthia-norman/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3416:\"<p><br />In 2015, the WordPress Foundation <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2015/01/15/remembering-kim-parsell/\">established an annual memorial scholarship</a> to honor the memory of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/11/people-of-wordpress-kim-parsell/\">Kim Parsell</a>, a beloved and influential contributor to the WordPress community.

Beforehand, you often ask yourself a hundred and one questions about what to say, how to say it, and how to approach people. But don’t worry—we can help. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is extremely important in the professional world. It allows for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and forming partnerships that are hard to find elsewhere. In this article, we&#8217;ll share advice and strategies to boost your confidence, establish meaningful connections, and make the most out of networking events. Whether you are an experienced professional or a first-time attendee, let’s see how you can maximize your impact at conferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exploring top tips for networking at a conference</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Have a clear agenda</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you define your goals upfront. These might include investigating new trends, connecting with specific individuals, or promoting your product/service. Setting these goals lets you focus your efforts and measure your success. Ask yourself: <em>What do you want from this networking event?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Research attendees and participants in advance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before attending a professional conference, have a close look at the conference agenda and attendee list to pinpoint key speakers, industry leaders, and influencers. Researching speakers and attendees beforehand makes it easy to figure out who you should be speaking to! Research key people on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/login\">LinkedIn</a> and other relevant social media profiles. A great strategy for this is to see if they have a <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> profile, as this will contain all their social media information and other important links and give a solid overview of what they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.gif?w=600\" alt=\"Nigel Cameron’s Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1520\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/nigelcameron\">Nigel Cameron’s Gravatar profile</a> provides a snapshot of his engagement in technology and policy discussions, which could be important for meaningful interactions at the conference. Establish clear goals for whom to meet, which sessions to attend, and the outcomes you aim to achieve. This preparation will ensure your event time is productive and impactful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Establish connections beforehand and create a meeting schedule</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan ahead by contacting potential connections via email or social media. Use platforms like LinkedIn to introduce yourself and express interest in meeting. You can also use <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/\">Google Calendar</a> or conference apps to schedule face-to-face meetings. This means you won’t miss anyone you plan to talk to, nor do you have to awkwardly approach them!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Strengthen existing connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While forming new connections is important, don&#8217;t forget to nurture existing relationships. Reinforcing pre-existing ties can lead to deeper professional ties and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>After an initial meeting, follow up with a personalized message referencing previous interactions, shared interests, and potential for future collaboration. You can take it a step further by scheduling a one-on-one meeting during the conference and using that time to catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Make time for new networking opportunities</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-structured schedule is great, but allowing room for spontaneous networking opportunities is equally important. These unplanned moments can often lead to the most valuable connections and insights.<br /><br />Be open to impromptu meetups or casual conversations in common areas like coffee shops, lounges, or hallways. If you overhear a discussion that piques your interest, please join in and contribute your thoughts politely. These organic interactions can generate genuine connections and reveal shared interests or challenges.<br /><br />Another way to embrace spontaneity is to participate in conference-specific social media hashtags. Many attendees use these hashtags to share insights, ask questions, and arrange informal gatherings to further professional relationships, which brings us to the next point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leverage social media to amplify your conference presence</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify the official platforms and social profiles used by the conference, and engage with them to maximize your visibility. Share compelling content that resonates with your audience throughout the event, including session takeaways, personal insights, and behind-the-scenes moments. Actively engage with posts from speakers, attendees, and influencers to cultivate meaningful online interactions that can translate into valuable offline connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When live-tweeting or providing real-time updates, balance digital engagement and in-person networking. Remember, while social media offers a powerful platform for extending your reach, face-to-face interactions remain essential for building lasting relationships and maximizing the impact of your conference experience. Using social media, you can amplify your presence, create meaningful connections, and leave a lasting impression on virtual and physical audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Prepare conversation starters and ask leading questions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Engaging in meaningful conversations at conferences begins with the right conversation starters. Personalized openers are more impactful than generic ones, as they demonstrate genuine interest and help you stand out. One of the most important things you can do is to make sure you appear curious and knowledgeable by asking informed questions about current industry trends or recent publications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the event, research industry news and trends to develop conversation starters tailored to different professionals you might meet, such as developers, executives, or marketers. Consider asking leading questions that prompt thoughtful discussions and enable you to better understand the other person&#8217;s perspective and challenges. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For developers</strong>: &#8220;I noticed your recent project on <a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a>. Can you tell me more about the technology stack you used and any challenges you faced?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For executives</strong>: &#8220;I read about your company&#8217;s recent expansion into international markets. What drove that decision, and what are your goals for the future?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For marketers</strong>: &#8220;I saw your recent article on social media strategies. How will emerging platforms impact marketing efforts in the coming year?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, ask questions that show genuine interest in the other person&#8217;s work and experiences!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Refine your elevator pitch</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crafting an elevator pitch is a great way to make a memorable first impression at conferences. Start by determining the core message of your professional narrative. Ask yourself what sets you apart and makes you memorable. Focus on your value to potential contacts or employers, highlighting how your skills and expertise can benefit them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your pitch concise, aiming for 30 to 60 seconds to respect the listener&#8217;s time and maintain their attention. Ensure your pitch is adaptable, allowing you to tailor it to different audiences and situations for maximum impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plan your exit strategy</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a solid exit plan is not just about escaping a failed conversation; it&#8217;s a crucial aspect of professional networking that allows you to gracefully transition between interactions and make the most of your time at a conference. A well-crafted exit strategy enables you to smoothly end conversations, both successful and unsuccessful, while maintaining positive connections and your reputation. Knowing when to politely wrap up an interaction is just as important as starting one, as overextending a conversation can be detrimental. Clear exit strategies and steps can minimize disruptions, help you adapt strategically to new possibilities, and ensure you have the opportunity to connect with a diverse range of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it right:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Understanding social cues</strong>: Read body language and conversational cues to gauge when to exit a conversation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Creating natural transition points</strong>: Guide conversations toward a courteous conclusion by finding natural pauses or wrapping up current topics.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Offering a tangible follow-up</strong>: Suggest specific ways to reconnect, such as exchanging emails or connecting on LinkedIn, and use tools like <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> to streamline the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Excusing yourself politely</strong>: Use phrases like &#8220;It&#8217;s been great chatting, but I don&#8217;t want to monopolize your time&#8221; to signal departure graciously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Timing your departure</strong>: Find the right moment to leave, neither lingering too long nor exiting abruptly, to ensure a positive impression.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Use Gravatar as your contact-sharing app</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"373\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-8.png?w=660\" alt=\"Gravatar profile example\" class=\"wp-image-1521\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> as your go-to contact-sharing tool can revolutionize your conference experience. Gravatar is a platform that allows you to create a comprehensive professional profile linked to your email address. This profile contains essential information about yourself, including your photo, bio, and contact details, making it an ideal touchpoint for networking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s why Gravatar stands out and how to make the most of its features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Universal profile consistency</strong>: Gravatar ensures consistency across multiple platforms with a single, universal profile image and information. This unified presence enhances <a href=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/04/10/personal-branding-tools/\">personal branding</a>, making it easier for new contacts to recognize and recall you amidst the conference crowd.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-9.png?w=660\" alt=\"Using links in your Gravatar profile\" class=\"wp-image-1522\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Displaying social information and relevant links</strong>: Integrate direct links to your relevant social networks (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/login\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">X/Twitter</a>) within your Gravatar profile. This allows contacts to explore your online identity and connect with you across various platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-10.png?w=660\" alt=\"Adding contact information\" class=\"wp-image-1523\" />\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adding contact details</strong>: Enhance accessibility by including essential contact information such as your business email and phone number (if comfortable sharing publicly). Additionally, integrate your online calendar into your Gravatar profile, simplifying the process for contacts to schedule follow-up meetings and engagements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Privacy controls</strong>: Gravatar empowers users with privacy controls, allowing selective sharing of personal information. You can publicly display only the contact details you&#8217;re comfortable sharing, maintaining control over your privacy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it even easier to share your contact details, you can add a QR code that connects to your Gravatar profile on your conference tag or business card. By doing this, you can make it more visible and accessible for potential connections. Check out <a href=\"https://docs.gravatar.com/profiles/qr-codes/#:~:text=QR%20Codes%20are%202%2Ddimensional,page%20for%20the%20requested%20profile\">Gravatar’s step-by-step instructions</a> on creating QR codes for details!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow up with your connections</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking is an ongoing process. Cultivating relationships requires follow-ups to solidify connections and create meaningful engagement. Here&#8217;s how you can effectively follow up with your connections:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Encouraging follow-ups with Gravatar</strong>: Include your email, phone number, online calendar, and contact form to increase the chances of people contacting you. Gravatar makes it easy for others to contact you and promotes proactive communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CRM systems</strong>: Use Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems to track new connections and manage interactions smoothly. Integrating with email tools allows you to send automated messages and set reminders for follow-up tasks to ensure no missed connections.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Template messages</strong>: Prepare message templates in advance that can be personalized for each new connection. This improves the follow-up process while maintaining a personalized touch that resonates with recipients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Workflow automation</strong>: Implement workflow automation to trigger a series of actions post-conference. Set up sequences for LinkedIn connection requests, thank-you emails, and reminder tasks for future follow-ups. This ensures consistent engagement and maximizes the potential of your networking efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Transform connections into career milestones with Gravatar</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With these tips, you&#8217;re ready for any networking event or conference. To be even more prepared, create your Gravatar profile.

nedan.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#russian\">Это эссе также есть на русском ниже.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of ways to contribute to WordPress, many of which require no coding skills. Here, I’d like to share my journey into WordPress and what this project means to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Who am I?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m Swedish but have been living abroad for the last 23 years. I like technology in general, IT and Telecom in particular. I love writing and do it regularly in three languages: English, Swedish, and Russian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professionally, I’ve gained lot of experience over the last 30 years as Project Manager, Product Manager, and Change Manager, mainly in Telecom and IT. During this time, I have lived and worked in ten countries. I’ve been leading small and large teams, working both on-site and remotely, in positions with both system vendors and operator companies (startups, as well as large, mature companies). I’ve been doing both traditional “waterfall” projects, and leading Scrum teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, between projects, I’ve also worked many years as a professional linguist (English, Swedish, and Russian).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Discovering WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started blogging in Russian on a different platform in early 2005. A couple of years later I picked up writing poetry and short form fiction in Swedish, publishing it initially on a specialized Swedish resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, I decided to gather most of my writing in one place. I got me a domain, installed WordPress and built my own three-language web site. I still remember how magically easy it was to migrate my Russian blog from LiveJournal to WordPress already in 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Initial contribution to the WordPress eco-system</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For use on my own sites, I improved the Swedish and Russian translations of the theme I was using and shared these translations with the theme developer for other people to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Contributing more actively</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress was fun. Now and then I help friends and family setting up simple sites. I was gradually becoming more interested in participating in the making of WordPress as a way of giving back to the community. I happened to have some spare time available when WordPress 4.7 was being prepared. Being a professional translator, I quickly suggested several hundreds of strings for the Swedish translation and was quickly promoted to General Translation Editor for Swedish. Soon I was expanding and mentoring the Swedish translation team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>But there was more to it</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an experienced Project Manager and Change Manager, I strived to understand the fuller picture better, and helped fellow GTEs for other language teams to discuss and solve problems they encountered. Here, too, I was soon promoted to team representative and global mentor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I’ve been contributing in several ways: co-organizer of a WordCamp in Stockholm, co-organizer of several translation events, Support contributor (especially in the Swedish support forum), as speaker, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, I’ve participated actively in discussions around improving “discoverability” of contributing to WordPress and creating smoother on-boarding for new contributors. I also participated as mentor in the pilot cohorts of our new mentoring program for new contributors. This kind of building structure and improving processes come naturally to me, because of my professional experience and my interests in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want the WordPress community to become even stronger and more sustainable. There’s much more to be done, especially when it comes to building up strong local communities that can translate, train, popularize and support WordPress in many different languages and locations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d be enormously happy to contribute much more to these processes. A perfect solution would be to become a full-time sponsored contributor, where I’d be fully able to bring big value. It may go the other way, too: If I get hired for some intensive project, I may not have time and energy for WordPress, even if contributing here brings me happiness and fulfillment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tor-Björn (Tobi) Fjellner</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6848_4286a0-c6 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6848_c4c0da-d7\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p><strong>You can start contributing to WordPress today:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more than 20 volunteer teams contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, there are teams that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>translate WordPress to more than 60 language versions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>develop and maintain documentation (in several languages)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>create trainings and self-study material (in several languages)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>edit, subtitle, and publish video recordings of presentations</li>\n\n\n\n<li>organize meetups and WordPress conferences</li>\n\n\n\n<li>gather photos and other media files that are free to use on any site</li>\n\n\n\n<li>… and much more</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/\">https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/</a> to find which team suits you the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>See a list of the main teams at <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">https://make.wordpress.org/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Register your personal forum account at <a href=\"https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=en_US\">https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=en_US</a>&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Search a WordPress event near you at <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/\">https://events.wordpress.org/</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_c1e170-ec wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Welcome!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"svenska\" class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_83d9c3-1c wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Att tillföra stort värde till WordPress utan programmering</h1>\n\n\n\nHär läser Tobi själv sin berättelse på svenska.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Man kan bidra till WordPress på många sätt, och långt ifrån alla kräver kunskaper i programmering. Här vill jag berätta om hur jag hittade fram till WordPress och vad projektet betyder för mig personligen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Vem är jag?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag är från Sverige men bor utomlands sedan 23 år. Jag gillar teknik i allmänhet, framför allt IT och telekom. Jag älskar att skriva och gör det regelbundet på tre olika språk: engelska, svenska och ryska.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genom mina jobb har jag samlat på mig stor erfarenhet under de senaste 30 åren som projektledare, produktchef och change manager, främst inom telekom och IT. Sammanlagt har jag bott och arbetat i tio länder. Jag har lett både små och stora team, arbetat direkt på plats och på distans, för både systemleverantörer och telekomoperatörer (både nystartade och etablerade operatörer). Jag har både arbetat med traditionellt projektformat och lett Scrum-team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mellan projekten, har jag också arbetat många år som professionell översättare och redaktör (på engelska, svenska och ryska).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hur jag upptäckte WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag började blogga på ryska på en annan plattform i början av 2005. Ett par år senare började jag skriva poesi och korta skönlitterära texter på svenska, som jag i början publicerade på en specialiserad webbplats (poeter.se).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>År 2011 bestämde jag mig för att samla det mesta av mitt skrivande på en plats. Jag skaffade en domän, installerade WordPress och byggde min egen trespråkiga webbplats. Jag minns fortfarande hur magiskt enkelt det var att migrera min ryska blogg från LiveJournal till WordPress redan år 2011.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mitt första bidrag till WordPress ekosystem</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag förbättrade de svenska och ryska översättningarna av temat jag använde för eget bruk och skickade dem även till temats utvecklare så att andra kunde ha nytta av dem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bidrar mer aktivt</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Det var roligt att använda WordPress. Ibland hjälpte jag familj och vänner att skapa enkla webbplatser. Efterhand började jag intressera mig mer för att bidra till WordPress som ett sätt att ge tillbaka till communityn. Jag råkade ha tid över när WordPress 4.7 var på väg att lanseras. Med min erfarenhet som professionell översättare föreslog jag svenska översättningar för hundratals strängar och blev snabbt befordrad till svensk översättningsredaktör för WordPress (General Translation Editor). Kort därefter var jag sysselsatt med att hitta fler översättare och fungera som mentor för det svenska översättningsteamet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mer än så</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Som erfaren projektledare och förändringsledare strävade jag efter att förstå helhetsbilden bättre och hjälpte även GTE:er med råd och stöd om de undrade över något. Även här blev jag snart befordrad till teamrepresentant och global mentor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sedan dess har jag bidragit på flera sätt: jag var med och organiserade en WordCamp-konferens i Stockholm, medorganisatör av flera översättningsevenemang, aktiv i supportforumen (särskilt det svenska supportforumet), talare på konferenser, med mera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>På senare tid deltar jag aktivt i diskussioner kring hur vi kan göra det enklare att ”upptäcka” möjligheter att bidra till WordPress och göra processen smidigare för nya volontärer. Jag deltog också som mentor i pilotomgångarna av vårt nya mentorprogram för nya bidragsgivare. Att strukturera verksamhet och förbättra processer är naturligt för mig, som en följd av min yrkeserfarenhet och intressen i allmänhet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Min önskan är att WordPress-communityn ska bli ännu starkare och tåligare. Det går att göra mycket mer, i synnerhet när det gäller att bygga upp starka lokala communities som kan översätta, skapa utbildning, popularisera och stödja WordPress på många olika språk runt om i världen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag vore enormt glad om jag får möjlighet att bidra mycket mer till dessa processer. En perfekt lösning skulle vara att bli en WordPress-volontär på heltid med sponsring från något företag i branschen. Jag kommer att kunna tillföra stort värde. Det kan gå åt andra hållet också: Om jag får anställning med något intensivt och krävande projekt utanför WordPress kanske jag inte kommer att hinna eller orka att bidra till WordPress, trots att det ger mig glädje och tillfredsställelse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tor-Björn (Tobi) Fjellner</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id6848_182f9a-32 alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top kb-theme-content-width\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column6848_e5a438-c6\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p>Du kan börja bidra till WordPress idag:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Det finns över 20 volontärteam som bidrar till WordPress på olika sätt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Till exempel finns det team som:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>översätter WordPress till fler än 60 språkversioner</li>\n\n\n\n<li>utvecklar och underhåller dokumentation (på flera språk)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>skapar utbildningar och självstudiematerial (på flera språk)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>redigerar, undertexter och publicerar videoinspelningar av presentationer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>organiserar träffar och WordPress-konferenser</li>\n\n\n\n<li>samlar foton och andra mediafiler som är fria att använda på vilken webbplats som helst</li>\n\n\n\n<li>och mycket mer</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gå till https://make.wordpress.org/contribute/ för att hitta vilket team som passar dig bäst.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Du kan också:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Se en lista över de viktigaste teamen på <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">https://make.wordpress.org/</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Registrera ditt personliga forumkonto på <a href=\"https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=sv_SE\">https://login.wordpress.org/register?locale=sv_SE</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Söka efter ett WordPress-evenemang nära dig via https://events.wordpress.org/</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_5a4fda-7d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Välkommen!</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"russian\" class=\"kt-adv-heading6848_f180c3-95 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Как быть полезным для WordPress если ты не программист</strong></h1>\n\n\n\nТут Тоби сам читает свой рассказ.\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Есть ряд способов внести свой вклад в WordPress, и многие из них не требуют навыков программирования. Хочу поделиться своим путем в WordPress и тем, что этот проект значит для меня.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Кто я?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я швед, но живу за границей последние 23 года. Мне нравится технологии в целом, а IT и телекоммуникации в частности. Я люблю писать и делаю это регулярно на трех языках: английском, шведском и русском.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>За последние 30 лет я был менеджером проектов, менеджером по продуктам и менеджером по изменениям, главным образом в телекоммуникациях и IT. Жил и работал в десяти странах мира, в разных культурах. Я руководил малыми и большими командами, работал как на месте, так и удаленно. Работал и у поставщиков систем, и у операторских компаний (стартапы и крупные, зрелые компании). Я вел как проекты в традиционном стиле, так и руководил Scrum-командами. Как видите, у меня богатый и разносторонний опыт.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Кроме этого, между проектами, я также много лет работаю профессиональным переводчиком и редактором (на английском, шведском и русском). Языки моë особое увлечение.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Как я пришел в WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я начал вести блог на русском языке на другой платформе в начале 2005 года. Спустя пару лет я начал писать стихи и короткие рассказы на шведском. В начале я публиковал эти тексты нa специализированном сайте.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В 2011 году я решил собрать большую часть своих произведений в одном месте, и выбрал для этого WordPress и построил свой собственный трёхъязычный сайт. Я до сих пор помню, как неожиданно легко было перенести мой русский блог с ЖЖ на WordPress, уже в 2011 году.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Первый вклад в экосистему WordPress</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я исправил русский и шведский переводы моей темы, и отправил их разработчику той самой темы, чтобы и другие люди могли пользоваться ими.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Активное участие</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress увлëк меня по-настоящему. Время от времени я помогал друзьям и семье настраивать простые сайты. В благодарность за то, что мне дал WordPress, мне захотелось внести свой вклад в проект.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>За месяц до выхода WordPress 4.7 у меня появилось немного свободного времени. Как профессиональный переводчик, я смог быстро предложить сотни строк для шведского перевода и тут же меня назначили общим редактором шведского перевода (GTE). После этого я начал расширять и наставлять шведскую переводческую команду.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Но это ещë не всë!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Как опытный Project Manager и Change Manager, я стремился лучше понять общую картину и помогал переводчикам на другие языки, когда у них возникали проблемы и вопросы. И вскоре я стал представителем команды и глобальным наставником.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>С тех пор, я вносил вклад в развитие WordPress различными способами: как соорганизатор WordCamp в Стокгольме, как соорганизатор нескольких переводческих мероприятий, как активный участник команды поддержки (особенно в шведском форуме поддержки), выступал на конференциях, и многое другое.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>В последнее время я активный член команды, которая популяризирует участие в развитие WordPress среди пользователей. Для новых участников проекта мы максимально облегчаем вход в проект. Я также был ментором в двух пилотных группах нашей новой программы по наставничеству. Оптимизация рабочих структур и процессов мне хорошо знакома по моей профессиональной деятельности, как Project Manager и Change Manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я хочу, чтобы сообщество WordPress становилось крепче и устойчивее. Есть много работы, особенно в формировании сильных команд в разных странах, для перевода, обучения, популяризации и поддержки WordPress на языках всего мира.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Я буду рад внести гораздо больший вклад в эти процессы.

The Grammarly-level editing and spell-check alone is amazing, on par with their math stuff.

This innovation should exist at the operating-system layer (I include browsers  and <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WASM</a> in this) not be replicated in every application. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a> plays into this trend.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> A pivotal moment in my WordPress journey was when someone invited me to a WordCamp. I was sort of aware of WordPress, but certainly not aware of the community or the ways of open source. And when I look back, there were a few things I wish I had known going in. I am, of course, an unapologetic extrovert and therefore unstoppable at events, but if you are headed to your first WordCamp and are feeling a little nervous or confused, then pop in some earbuds because the next 10 minutes are for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> We&#8217;re going to first take a look at some basic tactical things about WordCamps, and then I&#8217;m going to tell you a few, like, human things about being a human going to events. If you&#8217;re a dog going to these events, I think that your prep is different, but also that is not my area of expertise. So the first thing, some tactical stuff about going to WordCamps. All of this happens before you even get in the front door. And so this is stuff that you can do in the comfort of your own home, on your own time, using your own computer. If you&#8217;ve got questions, you&#8217;ve got a search engine nearby to take some quick searches. Make sure you know what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things first, the shape of a WordCamp. All WordCamps have at least one day of talks, one social event, and sponsors to connect to. Some also have extra events that you need to sign up for, like Contributor Days, workshops, things like that. But we&#8217;ll start with the main event, right? We&#8217;re going to start with the day of talks and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So when we&#8217;re looking at the main event of a WordCamp, what you should do is you should head to the WordCamp&#8217;s website and check out the schedule. I suggest that you plan for two, maybe three things that you might want to learn and look around at the schedule to see if there are any presenters or presentations that look like they fit those things that you think you might want to learn. Because if it&#8217;s not working for you, if it&#8217;s not teaching you something, then you don&#8217;t necessarily need to be in that one. Even if you&#8217;re not sure about a session a talk that you&#8217;re planning to go to, I recommend that you stop by, and then if you find out that it&#8217;s not for you, you can leave again.  That&#8217;s fine. But I do encourage you to go to at least one thing that feels a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feel lost right now. It at least gives you an idea of what to search for once you do get to that point. I would never have known the things to search for early on in my learning of WordPress without going to at least one or two sessions that were just way over my head. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Second thing is don&#8217;t forget to check when lunch is available. And if you have dietary restrictions, let them know ahead of time. I realize this sounds silly, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t focus when I&#8217;m hungry. But also, it&#8217;s really a great, low-stakes networking time, and I think one of the overlooked networking times as well. I mean, everyone&#8217;s gotta eat, right? And it&#8217;s easier to strike up a conversation over a meal than just out of thin air or, you know, in the middle of a presentation when you&#8217;re supposed to be listening to a talk. So yeah, check out when lunch is happening! And yeah, make a friend or two, sit down at a table, and ask somebody what they&#8217;re doing with WordPress and how long they&#8217;ve been doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing that I would recommend that you do when you&#8217;re looking at kind of the main event for a WordCamp is to schedule in time to wander around and meet the event sponsors. They are all experts in some WordPress problem or other, so probably they have a solution to a problem that you have got. But they&#8217;re also how we keep our prices super low, so even if you have no problems or you think you have no problems. Still, check them out. They&#8217;re also staffed with wonderful people that are building really cool stuff with WordPress and so you might just get some inspiration out there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Now for the side events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the side events, we&#8217;re going to kind of start close to the main event and work our way out. So you&#8217;ve got generally three types of side events if you don&#8217;t count the networking things, which, in this case, I&#8217;m not. But just know that almost every WordCamp has some networking event, either an after-party or, like, a happy hour, a social that happens before the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll get emails about those if you have signed up for updates on the website. Also, you can look on the website directly. Just check out the schedule. Always go to those. The networking is the best at a WordCamp. But the side events—we&#8217;re talking about specific types. Like I said, we&#8217;re going to start close and work our way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:11] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, workshops. These are just what they sound like. They&#8217;re classroom-style opportunities to practice the things you&#8217;ve learned at meetup events or on learn.WordPress.org, depending on how you found your way to this WordCamp. They mostly happen during the WordCamp itself. in a separate track, and there are like stacks of workshops in that track in that series of sessions. But a lot of them do require preregistration simply so that the trainer has an idea of how many people to expect. Again, if you get in the workshop and it&#8217;s way over your head, you feel like you absolutely cannot get it done, you&#8217;re always welcome to leave and check out some other area. But, in general, the workshops that we have WordCamps are pretty solid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a little bit further removed from that are our Youth and Teen Days. So this is more of an event series that is specifically designed for teens or kids who are trying to learn more about WordPress and other related business and entrepreneurial topics. It&#8217;s kind of a catch all but also has a lot of WordPress content in it. They have age limits, of course, and require separate registration for safety and planning purposes both. And those, in general, are either half-day during the WordCamp itself or a full-day during that WordCamp. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Which brings us then to the big one, the major side event. This is a full-day side event called Contributor Day. If your WordCamp has a Contributor Day, it will happen either the day before or the day after the WordCamp itself. It is an entire day where attendees come together to learn how to contribute to the future of the WordPress open source project. Now, if you are listening to this as part of, like, you&#8217;re getting ready to go to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what I meant by open source or open source project or WordPress open source project, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> You&#8217;re going to learn all about it at the Contributor Day if you go, but the TLDR is that this software that you are about to choose to build your website on is built by thousands of people across the planet who are looking for the best solutions to problems that they have in their businesses that probably you will encounter or have encountered before. There&#8217;s no new problems under the sun, and open source methodologies kind of use the collective wisdom of everybody who has ever worked with a WordPress project or site and ran into a problem that they had to solve on their own, like this open source project, this community of people just make sure that that wisdom is collected and standardized and made available for all of eternity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know. Low key. I&#8217;ve made Contributor Days sound so calming. However, that is a whole day thing. It happens before or after the WordCamp. It has separate registration so that organizers of your WordCamp can plan for how many folks need to be there to teach new and returning contributors, what to do. If I&#8217;m going to be honest, if you&#8217;re going to get overwhelmed at any WordPress event, it&#8217;s going to be one of these, but they are well worth the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Even if you just make a single contribution and never return, which I hope is not the case for you. I hope you do return. Even if you make a single contribution and never return, there&#8217;s something really grounding about seeing how much expertise and time, and care goes into this software that is, against all odds, completely free. So that&#8217;s all the tactical stuff, or a lot of it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It at least gives you a sense for what you&#8217;re getting yourself into for your first-ever wonderful WordPress weekend. But I promised you some human stuff too. So here is my considerably shorter list of stuff to bring as a human being going to a WordCamp. There&#8217;s an optional one. I&#8217;ll start you off with an optional one. Come with an idea of what you think you want to learn. You don&#8217;t have to come with that if you don&#8217;t want to. Some of us don&#8217;t know what we don&#8217;t know yet, and that&#8217;s fine too. But if you have a sense for what you think you need to learn, you&#8217;ll have an easier time figuring out how to spend your time while you&#8217;re here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> So, the non-optional things. Bring some way to exchange information. It can be QR codes, business cards, or pen and paper. It doesn&#8217;t really matter as long as it&#8217;s something that works for you to be sharing information with people that you meet. Because you never know when you&#8217;re going to meet your business soulmate, but the odds that you&#8217;re going to do it at a WordCamp are pretty dang high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing to bring is bring what you need to be comfortable. Bring your water bottle, a change of shoes if you need it, spare battery for your phone, your glasses. This day is going to be long enough without worrying about small inconveniences. So bring what you need to make yourself comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And finally bring your bravery. You will not know by looking at someone whether they&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for two years or two weeks. But you can know that at some point, they were in the first two days of trying to figure this all out. One of the most endearing things about this community is the zeal they bring to solving a problem. So if you get lost or stuck, just ask the person next to you. We all remember what it was like to know nothing, and we are rooting for you to succeed. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s your whole list. That&#8217;s everything you need to know to be the most prepared first-time attendee to a WordCamp ever. If that all sounded more overwhelming than just showing up, don&#8217;t worry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also just show up. That&#8217;s what I did. And even though I knew next to nothing, those WordCampers made me feel welcome and included and kept me coming back to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Ah, WordCamps. Gosh, I love those things. So glad that we&#8217;re all getting back together for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] (Music interlude) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> That brings us now, my friends, to our small list of big things. If you&#8217;re a first-time WordPresser, if you&#8217;ve never been to a WordCamp, and you don&#8217;t know what any of these things are, don&#8217;t worry; you can still go take a look at them, or you can wait until later when you&#8217;re less overwhelmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, but this is our small list of big things for middle of the year 2024. First thing on my list, the gender equality in WordPress businesses survey is still open. It aims to gain critical insight into the gender composition of leadership teams, the experiences of women and gender-diverse leaders and employees, and also take a look at the challenges and barriers to their career success. I care deeply about making sure that we have a way for folks who are traditionally and historically underrepresented in technology have a way to get into our space. Obviously, women and nonbinary folks are an area that I feel particularly called to help build those on-ramps for, but I have a great concern for that across the entire ecosystem and any intersection that we run into as we get more and more users into our space. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:30] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If you are a woman, if you work with women, if you work in WordPress, if you work in a WordPress business, go take that survey, and let&#8217;s see what we find out about what it&#8217;s like to work in this space, as somebody that we normally don&#8217;t see. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our list is that WordCamp Asia 2025 dates and venue have been revealed. So WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2024 were both major successes, and we are excited to share that the dates and venue for next year will be February 20th, 21st, 22nd in 2025 in Manila, and you&#8217;ll be able to go over to that website, take a look at it, we&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes as always and maybe start planning your your next big Asian adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:13] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The third thing on my list is this new contributor wizard questionnaire. So, there are more than 20 teams to contribute to in the WordPress project. They all show up at those Contributor Days that I talked about. But there are more than 20 of them. They work on different parts of the WordPress project every day. And our passionate community offers contribution opportunities for everyone. I know, we know, that finding the right team is the key to a meaningful contributor experience. So, our interactive questionnaire is here to help you determine where to start. It is sometimes difficult to know whether you can contribute to a software if you are a designer, if you are a writer, if you are in marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it turns out that you can contribute to WordPress with a bunch of skills that you otherwise would not have realized. So, we&#8217;ll have a link to the questionnaire in the show notes again. Also, it&#8217;s probably going to pop up on WordCamp sites, Contributor Day sites, anything that helps you all understand where you might find a little bit of success as a contributor is a good place for it to be. Take the questionnaire, see where you land, the WordPress sorting hat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:18] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And item number four. So we&#8217;ve made some updates, not we&#8217;ve made some updates, we have some updates from the Five for the Future program. So the Five for the Future program has a long history in the WordPress project. There are a couple of different episodes in this podcast where you can learn more about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, to bolster transparency and openness, we have an update on the current state of WordPress contributions as of the end of May 2024. In the past few months, we&#8217;ve made a lot of efforts to improve the program and contributor experience in WordPress. We&#8217;ve also done a little bit of work to kind of clean up the pledges that are in there for, people or companies or teams that have found that they couldn&#8217;t continue their contributions over time. That is fine too. But we&#8217;ll have a link to that update in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:09] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us on your favorite podcast app or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.6 beta one. The last three Gutenberg plugin releases 18.3, 18.4, and 18.5, and WordCamp Europe, not necessarily in this order. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project, sponsored the Automattic’s five for the future program. Today, I&#8217;m also happy to have Magdalena Paciorek as co-host with me. Magda has been one of the shining tutorial writers for the WordPress developer blog, and I&#8217;m also looking forward to learning more about building custom post types with blocks at WordCamp Europe. It&#8217;s definitely a topic that many developers have questions about. Magda, welcome to the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. Thanks for making the time today. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Hi, Birgit. Yeah, I&#8217;m great. I&#8217;m happy to present the new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome, awesome. So happy to have you on the show. So please tell us all more about you, where you live and what is your day job when you&#8217;re not writing for the developer blog, or presenting, or being a co-host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Okay. I live in Poland and well, I&#8217;m basically a WordPress developer. I work in the marketing department, where I do maintenance of our websites that are built with WordPress. I&#8217;m mostly responsible for maintaining our blocks that we built for our team, so that they can build landing pages for marketing purposes. So that&#8217;s where my interest in Gutenberg came from my team, because that&#8217;s what I do in my everyday job, but I also work in marketing, so I write content around WordPress. I present at WordCamps and other WordPress events. My company also sponsors WordPress events, so I would always also attend these events. So yeah, so my work life is pretty much also WordPress, and also sometimes after work, because of the community that I&#8217;m involved with. So it&#8217;s a big part of my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you have family?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: No, I don&#8217;t have kids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Wonderful, wonderful. So you might not have seen the tweet by Luis Herranz, &#8220;By the way. I think this is the best tutorial on the interactivity API available so far. It&#8217;s going to be my new recommendation for anyone looking for a quick introduction to the interactivity API.&#8221; That&#8217;s great. Kudos from one of the lead developers on the Interactivity API project, so congratulations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Well, thank you. I actually haven&#8217;t seen it, because I haven&#8217;t looked into Twitter for a long time, so wow, this is nice. Yeah, I&#8217;m really happy that I could contribute to this project, because I feel like the interactivity API is one of the most important features that are coming to work. I mean, it&#8217;s already in WordPress, but it&#8217;s just the first iteration, but I feel like when it&#8217;s going to be finished, wow, this is one of the most important things that is happening right now in WordPress. So yeah, it&#8217;s well cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and you help people to get acquainted with it. So thank you for that. And I agree with you, the interactivity API is probably the most interesting pieces also for people that come over to Gutenberg and from PHP developers, that are not so much interested in JavaScript, but they can also use that and hydrate their pages with interactivity, without page loads. So it&#8217;s really cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before we go into the Changelogs and talk about all the releases that are happening since we last had a podcast, well the 100th episode was a special episode as you dear listeners already know, hopefully. And so, we skipped a Gutenberg release and now we are putting it all in one show, and you will also notice that at the end of the show, that there will be a different music. And I thought, okay, for the next 200 episodes, I think it would be good to change the music, the intro music and the outro music, but to not confuse listeners right away, we didn&#8217;t do it for this one, but only for the outro music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next time we will have it on. So at the beginning of the show, just to warn you, it&#8217;s a totally different vibe on that music. While I have you, dear listeners, at the beginning of the show, I wanted to also let you know start with a few announcements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announcements of Upcoming Development Hours, WordCamp Europe and Hallway Hangouts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp Europe is happening next week and there will be awesome presentations there, and I put together a list of the seven block-related talks that you will see in the live stream. So I will link it in the show notes, but one of them is Elena&#8217;s presentation. Then we have a presentation on the interactivity API with Michael and on block themes, and all the good things that come with 6.6, or are already in WordPress. It&#8217;s also Jessica Lessig is talking about the Twenty Twenty Four. Then Erica Gill and Luis Rosales talk about migrating from two blocks from a legacy website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernie Rider, developer on the Gutenberg team, talks about the block hooks, how to extend block themes, and then there&#8217;s also the Gutenberg speed build challenge that Jamie Marsland has put up on YouTube, and you will get to see it live. And we just found out that Jessica Lessig and Rich Tabor are the contestants, so that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then, Jamie also has a talk about the three key principles for beginners on blog themes, and then of course Magdalena&#8217;s building custom post types blocks. So you see this all and you can get this all through the WordCamp Europe live stream, if you&#8217;re not there to watch it live.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there are three developer hours and two hallway hangouts scheduled in the next few weeks, so on June 11th, and of course all of them will have recordings and resources to share. So June 11th will be a developer hour on exploring overrides for the sync patterns that come with WordPress 6.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a very exciting feature and I&#8217;m really looking forward to using that. It was punted from 6.5, but the developers took a totally different approach now. One is they use the block bindings API to drive all the overrides, and then also you have to name the pieces so they can be displayed in the sidebar, but we are going to talk about it a little later. But that is definitely something you don&#8217;t want to miss, or want to catch on the rerun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 17th, no, it&#8217;s the 19th, sorry. On June 19th at 1100 UTC there will be a hallway hangout on building a workflow for themes with the CreateBlock theme plugin using Playground and GitHub. So you could use Playground to make all the changes to your theme. Use the plugin CreateBlock theme block theme plugin to save those things, and then use also Playground to save it all back to GitHub as a PR for a theme update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s going to be really cool. And then on June 25th, there&#8217;s developer hours on what&#8217;s new for theme developers in WordPress 6.6. That&#8217;s more an overview and kind of sometimes deep dive. And then on June 26th, a day later, 1100 UTC, there will be a hallway hangout on the grid layouts that come to WordPress 6.6, and we will discuss all the cool things with Isabel Brison, who was one of the lead developers on the grid layouts. And then July 2nd, and that&#8217;s the end of it. July 2nd is again another developer hours and building theme with the CreateBlock theme plugin, so you can learn more about all that. So that&#8217;s it. Discussions and QA also happen asynchronously, in the Make WordPress Outreach Channel, that&#8217;s a new name for a channel that was the FSE outreach experiment, but it&#8217;s now a standard channel on the WordPress makeup for extenders, developers, site builders to come together and discuss things, or have Q&amp;A with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, join us there. All right, that brings us to what&#8217;s released.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.6 Beta 1</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most, but not all items in the Gutenberg plugin releases we&#8217;ll cover today will come to WordPress 6.6 version at the end of July. I think release date is, no, release date is July 26th, but you can already start testing WordPress 6.6 beta 1 version, because it was just released and I would like to point out that it&#8217;s the best way to learn about new features coming to the WordPress version, when you heed the call for testing. It has been out for together with the WordPress 6.6 beta 1 release, and you get to test 10 features coming to WordPress 6.6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those are all the new data views that are in the site editor for pages, templates, patterns and template parts, and how they kind of work the same pattern overrides, so you can change the content of a pattern per instance, and then if you change the design, all the other patterns will change the design as well, but not change the content. So the updates to the insert are showing all blocks. A user feedback was there that it was a little bit confusing. It now shouldn&#8217;t be, but test it out. Unified and refresh publishing workflow. We have additional information about that later on. And then, mix and match the typography and color palettes from all style variations, and then section styles, and the changes to CSS, cascading style sheets, specificity. That&#8217;s a very difficult word, specificity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. And then, another feature coming to WordPress 6.6 is a grid layout, and then a new pattern experience for the classic themes. I did some brief testing with a classic theme activated and it works real nicely. Also, the sync pattern works as well. Of course the sync pattern overrides are only enabled for certain blocks, so it does not work on all patterns, but that&#8217;s a different story. Another feature that a lot of people have been waiting for are the negative margins in the UI of the global styles. And then, there is a feature also coming to WordPress 6.6 that allows for the rollback of auto updates if they run against some error message, or something like that. A team of developers has been working probably for, if not longer, a year on that, and now it&#8217;ll come to WordPress 6.6 and it&#8217;s definitely great to test this. Now Magdalena, are there any features in 6.6 release that you are particularly excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Well, yes, quite a few of these features are really exciting, but I&#8217;m the most excited about sync pattern overrides. I think this is a very important feature, especially for people who build websites for clients, because it solves the problem that the page builders basically have, that you build views of pages, and then you have some common elements that you add to a few pages for example. But then when you want to change something, well you had to visit every page separately and make these changes. For example, change background code. And so, that&#8217;s of course, if you have a very small brochure website with five pages, not a problem, but it doesn&#8217;t scale, the website grows, then it&#8217;s not really usable. So these synchronized patterns that you can overwrite are a really great solution for this, because you can keep styles synchronized, but then allow overwriting text for example, the content of these patterns per page. So it&#8217;s a great feature, I really like it. I think everyone should get interested in it actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think a lot of people got already excited for 6.5, when it was pulled off the beta 1, because it wasn&#8217;t ready yet, but I think the additional two or three months maturing of the feature definitely helped to make it even more clear how to assign those allowed overrides, and how a user that uses them, an editor that hasn&#8217;t created them, but wants to use them, can identify the areas where they can override things. Now there are a few caveats there. One is that the overrides are only enabled for headings, paragraphs, buttons, and images, and in images only for the alt text and the file name. So if you put captions in, the captions are not part of the overrides. So somebody did some great testing there and you need to, if you want to test it out with captions and yeah, it&#8217;s probably not going to work as you expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And there&#8217;s one more limitation, because I&#8217;ve tested it with gallery block and you can override the images, but we can set them to be able to be overwritten. But the problem is when the number of photos that add to the gallery, it can&#8217;t be changed. So if you add for example, two pictures, there can only be two, they can be three or one. So it&#8217;s not a hundred percent usable, but I&#8217;ve read the discussion on GitHub, and I feel like this is going to be solved in probably the next release, but for now, this is something to be aware of. Also, the same situation with the list book, where you have a few items, and then you can&#8217;t add or remove these items from the async pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, list block is not part of that. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. Gallery block is not assigned yet that it works. So yeah, those are the limitations, but for a first version to get in a major WordPress release, it&#8217;s in really great shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, yes, I confirm it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And every other feature, there&#8217;s a good first version and then we iterate on for the next steps on that. So yeah, I&#8217;m also quite excited about the section styles and the grid layout, because that&#8217;s also a part of what other page builders do, is that you can assign different styles to sections and not have to go to each part of it. So if it&#8217;s a cover block or a groups block of certain elements, you can change all the colors with a color palette kind of thing, and assign a style to it, and have that on a button change over to either dark view, or light view, or blue view, or red view kind of thing. But you don&#8217;t have to do it for each single block in that group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are really time savers, but they also give designers a little more granular control over the designs that they create. And the grid layout is definitely something that a lot of people have been waiting for, that you arrange everything on your page in a grid, and then you can wrap the handles of a block and kind of make it larger, or have a row span of a block, be it an image, or a paragraph block, or anything, and to organize the blocks differently on a page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that really helps with that, some people are still looking for pixel perfect, although that one went out of the window when we had mobile, and different kinds of screen sizes and we now have. I don&#8217;t know, from brownie size screen to big TV screens that are 80 inches. So yeah, we need some fluid things there. And the grid layout, if you use the automatic grid layout, it will be responsive and adhere to the various screen sizes. And negative margin is part of it as well, with the section styles and the grid layout to give more tools to the designers to have really great designs that are not following conservative flows of content and assets. Well if your listeners have a comment on that, just use the comment section on the website and let us know what you think about all the new features that are coming to WordPress 6.6. And as I said, go and test it, heed the call for testing, and you learn all about it quite by doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.3</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to the first Gutenberg plugin release that we are going to cover. That&#8217;s Gutenberg 18.3. There were 165 PRs in there. It was released on May 8th, by 44 contributors and three contributors who were first timers, Jason Crist was the release lead for that release. Well, one definitely stands out is that Gutenberg is updated to a new React version. I think it&#8217;s 18.3, was it? I&#8217;m not quite sure. Yeah, it&#8217;s just a coincidence that 18.3 Gutenberg release also uses React 18.3, so I was a little confused at the moment here. And that will be important when you use some of the newer features, or if you have to update some of the legacy React features on your blocks. I&#8217;m not quite sure how much of a disruption that is or if it is at all, but I just wanted you to be aware of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah, this one I don&#8217;t actually know. I&#8217;ve checked it out, but I couldn&#8217;t make it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, yeah, that&#8217;s a different story. It&#8217;s a different story. It doesn&#8217;t have to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Okay. It&#8217;s there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Everything needs to be tested of course, and it&#8217;s supposed to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Onto the next thing. Also, the plugin document settings panel is now available, a slot is available in the template inspector controls, because before this release it was only available I think in post inspector contract, but now it&#8217;ll be also available in the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The site editor. Yeah, and that is so plugins can have additional fields and create their own little interfaces there. The next one is classic themes get now exposure to the patterns page, and what it also removes is the template parts menu item. So classic themes now have access to the site editor design for patterns and template parts. There was a request from quite a few theme developers if that would be possible, or agency developers if that would be possible, because then they can also do all the documentation, everything for the patterns can be also used for classic themes, or users that use the classic theme. So that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciore</em>k: Yeah, that&#8217;s a great feature. And also patterns, the data view is changing. The team has removed icons and right now it&#8217;ll just have this label that says that if the pattern is synchronized or not. So yeah, that&#8217;s also a really nice improvement. Small, but very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And one other PR I wanted to point out is that now you can insert patterns on the end of the canvas, or the route section of a content piece. Until then you couldn&#8217;t get to that. It was really hard to put anything on the end of a post or pages, but now you can insert patterns to the end of it by drag and drop, or just by using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah, this is a really nice usability improvement. I actually tested it and it worked really nicely. It&#8217;s a natural flow. It seems very natural to add new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can now just drop and drag them to the end, because then you can stack your patterns first before you make all the changes that you need to do on the page. So you can get a really good layout very fast to just combine a few patterns, and you don&#8217;t have to rearrange them on your site. Next one is a new text alignment control component that&#8217;s for developers, when you have a few&#8230; Most text aligns are actually in the block toolbar, but some of the blocks don&#8217;t have have it in their block toolbar, but you can have it in the font section, the typography section of that block, so you can have a left center or right alignment on the text, even if the block toolbar is not there. So it&#8217;s really cool. That&#8217;s especially helpful also for custom blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, and we also have a new improvement on the inserter tabs, because now the search bar is moved into inserter tabs. So when you type, for example, you look for the keyword, like for example, image, and you look on the block tab. Then when you switch to the patterns tab, then you still have this search phrase there and it already filters out the patterns based on this keyword. So this is a really nice improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I saw that too, and I really love that, that I don&#8217;t have to tap in my keywords multiple times just because I&#8217;m going from blocks to patterns to the other thing. Well, I mentioned it with 18.3 Gutenberg plugin. There is now the possibility to add negative values to margin controls. So you can have overlaps, so you can have a picture and then the next paragraph you can have the margin negative 200, and it goes a little bit into the picture on the bottom of it if you want to do that. That is something that many designers have done for many, many years with just plain Cascading Style Sheets, and it was available through the theme JSON where you could add negative margins already, but now it&#8217;s also coming to the user interface, and it will be in the dimension controls on the bottom of the margin, you can see add your negative values for any of the margins, be it left, right, top or bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: In the next feature, I think it&#8217;s only relevant for the team developers. I think so, because there is a big change to how the style variations are handled in Orpheus 6.6. Okay, so another feature is I think it should only concern the theme developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Are you trying to tell me that this is something that developers actually wouldn&#8217;t be able to use, or that&#8217;s not for developers that it&#8217;s actually just Gutenberg internal?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I think it&#8217;s internal for Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So we don&#8217;t talk about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah, yeah, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If it&#8217;s not for extenders, then it&#8217;s not really&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I don&#8217;t think they have to do anything. It&#8217;s just how it handles when you define two or three type variations, and then people mix and match it, so it&#8217;s something internal that handles it. Not to create too many styles under the hood, something like that, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think I saw another filter to have the color controls and the typography styles, that they are not duplicated and all that. The team is working on that. That&#8217;s the next one, is the filter out color and typography variations. That&#8217;s also an internal one, but I think it could open up the system for the next version to be able to maybe opt out of the presets, the automatic creation. So color and typography variations when they come in, they are taken from the style variations the theme has, and isolates in a separate section, all the color palettes that come with the style variations, and in a separate section also all the typography choices that could be made for the style variations. And there is a discussion for extenders. Well, if a theme is following brand standards that has four style variations for the different brands of a company, then you don&#8217;t want colors from brand two and the typography from brand three to be maxed, and that is not yet available to opt out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think how the filters were created, I think it would only be a small step to provide that opt out for theme developers. So I think we need to watch that space quite a bit in terms of what feedback is coming in from the beta version, and also see how that can be solved. It might not be part of 6.6, because we are six weeks away from release, but there might be time. So it&#8217;s certainly something to discuss with theme developers, agency developers, and the good mood developers. Which also brings us to the new preset, there are default font sizes in theme JSON version three, that for those you can opt out of course. Core has a few font sizes in the theme JSON and provides some. So those don&#8217;t have to be worried about theme developers if they don&#8217;t want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Especially if you create a custom for a company, then you might want to opt out from the default font sizes and declare your own ones. And onto the next one. There are some changes in the post editor sidebar. There are a few data information about the post was shuffled around in the top area of this site editor. For example, post status work count, also the thumbnail was moved to the top of site panel. So there are quite a few changes that I&#8217;ve seen throughout these three releases of Gutenberg that we&#8217;re talking about. So it&#8217;s not a big change, because the data is still there, the same data, but it got moved up or down, and I think at the moment it&#8217;s looking quite nice. It&#8217;s quite usable, so it&#8217;s definitely worth it to take a closer look at how it looks like at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely is a change that gives you much more information about the nature of the post or the page that you have. And I&#8217;m seeing that the word count might disappear from the inserter, no from the list view tab, because not a lot of people are going there, but you have all the information in the top section of the post editor. And they also moved up the featured image, and that is part of the also data views, because now they can use the same component and show off in a grid layout for pages or posts. They can show off the card with the featured image, and just the post metadata about their post status, and word count, and last edited information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s also a feature that comes in actually is the duplicate post feature that you can just grab from that section, where you can say, okay, duplicate that post and then restart a new one. Up until now, you actually had to use a plugin for that, and right now it&#8217;s actually only available in the Gutenberg plugin. I&#8217;m not sure it comes to WordPress 6.6, I need to research that. So you might get too excited now, but if you use the Gutenberg plugin, you definitely have it, but it seems to be only for the plugin right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: But it&#8217;s such a needed feature, just to be only available through plugins, but now it&#8217;s coming to WordPress, it&#8217;s really great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so now we have documentation. There&#8217;s a lot of going on in the documentation field, especially the editor package of Gutenberg. The documentation for this package was updated and at the moment I think almost all components are documented, so it&#8217;s great for developers who want to use these components from the editor package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It definitely made some strides with the documentation on the components. Some of the components actually moved from one package to the other, because of the synchronization from the site editor and the post editor. So there is no duplication of code anymore, but they had to move the packages. And so, they also moved some of the documentation and made the discovery that some of the components were actually not documented well enough. So there were two birds with one stone so to speak. Speaking of moving the interactivity, API documentation has also moved from the package area to the reference guide area. When you go to the developer.wordpress.org/block editor documentation, you&#8217;ll find it under different heading in the reference guide and another update that you as if you do theme development or create themes for clients, you definitely want to look at the documentation for the theme JSON version three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few changes and you need to declare it in your theme JSON, which schema you&#8217;re following to make sure that you are still compatible. All right, that was 18.3. See that was pretty harmless. Cool. Yeah, we&#8217;re getting better at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.4</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to the Gutenberg 18.4 release, which was released two weeks ago with 185 PRs, merged by 58 contributors, seven of them were new with their first merge PRs, and release lead was Alex Lende and he has all published release post what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 18.4. So let&#8217;s dive in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first item I wanted to point out was that the grid layout, visualizer and resizer features have been stabilized, and we can always cheer about that. The listeners, I think grid layout is going to be the new gradient. I had an early times on the podcast, even with Mark Uraine. Again, I was always very happy to say gradients and new features, and now it&#8217;s grid layout with new features. I&#8217;m really happy about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, this feature is definitely going to be useful, very useful, very excited about it. And the next feature that&#8217;s coming, this Gutenberg version is the aspect ratio presets are now supported through theme JSON. So you can define your own aspect ratios for images basically. That will be available in the controls for the cropping images. So I think this is great, especially for the theme developers, that you can now have your own dimensions of the images that are custom to the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it definitely makes some nice designs when you can have images uploaded and they follow your personalized, so to speak, aspect ratio presets. Also, there was an update on color variations. I mean, the PR isn&#8217;t very descriptive what that means, but it is that it moves the color presets to the palette tab in the global styles. So there will now be a palette section in the sidebar, in the right sidebar under the global styles, where you see palettes, and then you click on it and it gives you all the palettes that are set for the themes, or the style variations, or something. So it&#8217;s a nice UI change. It also follows quite a few other design tools that have a similar feature. So I&#8217;m really glad about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Okay, the next change is interesting for developers, because it&#8217;s a change to the register block style function. This function now accepts an array of blocks and it used to accept only a string with the block name. So what it means, you can now register a block style for multiple blocks at once with this one function, and you don&#8217;t have to do it separately. So this is nice if you have some common style that you would like to apply to a few blocks, you can do it at once. Now with register block site function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s an excellent explanation. Thank you so much. Because I wasn&#8217;t quite sure when I read this beyond what actually changed, but now you can have the green border with the yellow background on not only the paragraph block, but also the group block as well, as the cover block, so you don&#8217;t have to write the code multiple times. And then, the next thing next is more about the block library. So some blocks have additional features, the list block has now block class name on the list, that is really, yeah, people were waiting to style the list block. It&#8217;s now the WP dash block dash list class, so you can style the overall list as well. I think the list items already had their own class names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And also, the new variation was added to the embeds block in Bluesky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s Bluesky?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I don&#8217;t know, I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Bluesky. And yeah, the proliferation of social networks is kind of going on and on and on. And Bluesky is a new social network that comes close to Twitter now, and it was actually founded by a former Twitter developer, and it kind of opened up now to the public. It was for two years now, just on invitation only, but now more people can go into Bluesky. They&#8217;re still not ready to open source it, but I think they at least open it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now you can have your social embed Bluesky posts as well with the embed block. So make block popover component public, meaning that now developers can also use it. And that is an additional block toolbar that you can use to kind of put your own stuff in there. I&#8217;m not quite, and have your own navigation pretty much in the block toolbar. I really am eager to try that out. I only saw some WooCommerce implementations, but I have not yet seen any documentation about that. So it definitely has the label needs dev note on the PR, but I&#8217;m excited about for any extension that is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And the next thing is a new keyboard shortcut was added. This shortcut, which is common G or Ctrl G, you can now create a group from the selected box. So we can select a few blocks and then with the shortcut, the group will be created for the&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. Yeah, it removes the searching for menu items that are kind of multiple levels deep in the block toolbar settings. The next one is enhanced block outlines and selection interactions. That means that you know where interactions happen, and there&#8217;s a blue outline on certain sections, and group blocks and all that. I think that has been a major improvement on the UI when you create content, that you actually have the outlines where you are and what you&#8217;re doing. I think with the sync patterns, those outlines also become quite important to signal where is the place where I can override some of that from sync pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Documentation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: In this version of Gutenberg also, the documentation was updated. We have quite a lot of items on the list, but I think it&#8217;s worth mentioning there were some new pages added to the interactivity API documentation about and FAQ. So I think it&#8217;s really important to read about it, as the interactivity API will have become more and more important in themes, especially in theme creation. I think it&#8217;s good to learn about it and I&#8217;m happy that the team provides the documentation for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I just want to highlight that for the interactivity API, there is some change that in the block JSON, you started to put in view script and that changed to view script module. So for the developers who have already been testing out some of the interactivity API directives, that&#8217;s a slight change. It&#8217;s not a breaking change, because I think they put in the controls, but just make sure that that is something to update. Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty much all I wanted to point out, except I mentioned it before that the pattern overrides, they&#8217;re now using block bindings API. So the pattern overrides are its own source for the block bindings API, but it follows the same block markup notation. So you could use a pattern and rewrite some of the block bindings or some of the overrides in code if you&#8217;ve ever wanted to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think it opens up the feature to maybe even be available for themes to add it to the theme patterns in further releases. Not for this one, but because it uses a common API. And if that is already in the markup of a pattern that comes with a theme in the patterns folder, those overrides could even be updated through a theme update or those patterns could even be updated through a theme update. So when the theme developer has a new way of designing those patterns, they could override the certain things and then every site who has that theme gets an update to it. That is actually a dream of a block theme developer right now, but I think with the pattern overrides using that block bindings API, it might come to pass. Definitely not in 6.6, but maybe 6.7 or 6.8. All right, I&#8217;m talking maybe I haven&#8217;t rolled that out, but it&#8217;s definitely on the list or it&#8217;s on the roadmap so to speak, to make those extensible. So we&#8217;ll see how that happens.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gutenberg 18.5</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That concludes our Gutenberg 18.4 and we are going right into Gutenberg 18.5 was released this week. The release lead was Vincente Canales with 295 PRs, just short of 300 PRs. That&#8217;s a mammoth release. There were also more contributors, and 71 contributors and 10 of them with first time contributors. So great. It&#8217;s not surprising that there are so many PRs in there, because Gutenberg 18.5 is the last Gutenberg plugin release that goes into WordPress 6.6 from the feature set. So everything after that, and if it&#8217;s a new feature or something that will not be part of WordPress 6.6, only bug fixes get in. So if there was an enhancement that needed to be made and to be valid for 6.6, it needed to get into that plugin release. And as we all know, if it weren&#8217;t for the last minute, not a whole lot would get done in the world, so we were all kind of just in time on some of the features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I promise you we would talk about some of the post summary updates. In 18.5, we had quite a few that were the sidebar for the documentation settings, or document settings, or post settings, or page settings. So you get some post format controls. They moved around the URL and the author on it, the trash button has been removed; it was too prominent. It&#8217;s now in the three.menu, where you also find the duplicate post feature and also the remove feature. And then, there is a post sticky setting is now a tarter. Yay. Anything else that if I get something? Oh yeah, the revisions panel is also under the three point menu, so if you want to look at revisions, you need to go three point menu and then click on the revisions. So it&#8217;s all a little bit well organized. Some of them new designs or the alignment was kind of adjusted and some of the features were not removed. They were in the three.menu. I think it&#8217;s important to know that because it looks a little bit different in the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, it definitely does. I also checked it out and at first you might be surprised, there is no trash button, there&#8217;s no revisions panel. But yeah, it&#8217;s just hidden under the menu, so it&#8217;s good to know about it. And then the next change in Gutenberg is how the custom CSS is handled, because you can add your custom CSS to override the ones that you can choose from the controls. Before, whenever you change the variation, the style variation, you would lose the changes to custom CSS that you&#8217;ve made. But now they are saved, and so you can switch the variations and your custom CSS will override the variation, the style that is in the variation. So yeah, actually this was needed, so it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s an enhancement. I think that&#8217;s a bug fix, because there was pretty much the expectation of anybody who put in custom CSS, that they are not disappearing when you&#8217;re just going to switch on the variations. You can make the argument on the other side as well, but I think the user put in the custom CSS, because neither the theme nor the variations gave them what they needed. So yes, that&#8217;s definitely a good bug fix. I don&#8217;t know if you checked out the data views, just as on our aside, the data views, they&#8217;re really coming together, and I like the modern look of that, and I wish they would come earlier to WPAdmin. But if you go to the make design site, Joen Asmussen just showed off the designs for the media library, and to bring some of that new admin also to the media library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they have great things to come. And I am going to share that design share from, I share the link to the design update, but Joen Asmussen in the show notes, so you can look up what&#8217;s in store for the next version or at least for the next time. That was just an aside. Yeah, I like the grid views, I like the layouts, I like the different actions. The only thing that I don&#8217;t like is when you look at the drop-downs in the data views on the right-hand side, they&#8217;re on top. They&#8217;re all kind of overlapping and it&#8217;s hard sometimes to see which one level deep am I looking at now. And for what I think there needs a little bit more refinement, but I think they&#8217;re really glorious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yes, because there are quite a few options to customize it to your needs. I really like it. I really like it that you can bring the thumbnail featured image to the list. It&#8217;s great. I think it was missing in all the current WPAdmin list, but here you can just switch it on with a click. It&#8217;s great. And also, I think the metadata, I don&#8217;t know if at the moment, but at some point I think it&#8217;ll be able to also switch it on the list view. So yeah, it&#8217;s very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m really looking forward to what other plugin developers are going to do with it for their own plugins, because of course that&#8217;s a pre-built component. Why not use it, when everybody else knows how to use it already? So use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: But it&#8217;s not ready for extending, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, no, well, not as the old admin. If you have in your plugin create a list view of something, some data, like you go out and grab some data from Spotify or something like that, and you want to display that in an admin section, you could use the list view component. That&#8217;s a public component that you could use for that particular plugin page. If you use custom post types, it&#8217;ll still be the old one, because that&#8217;s just the same interface, but because it&#8217;s not yet available for posts, it&#8217;s only for pages. So though there are some things that still need to be happening, of course. But yeah, if you have a separate page for your plugin settings or something like that, use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: You can use the component, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You can use the component, yeah. And it has I think some good documentation on these things. Yeah. All right. Where were we, side of the data views?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I think we&#8217;re on the background image, add support for relative theme path, URLs, and top level JSON styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What that means is that you can now set a background image for the body content if you want to through the theme JSON, and add it to the assets folder of your theme. And then everybody who uses the theme can use the background image. You don&#8217;t have to upload it through the media library to get it to be recognized as a background image, which is one step further that any theme developer would want the user to have to go. That sounded weird, but yeah. Yeah, you&#8217;ll figure it out. So the next thing is, as we had the default font size spacing in 18.4, I think in 18.5 theme JSON, or it also comes with default spacing sizes. So you can create your own presets for spacing the margins and the dimension, or the dimension controls through the JSON. And it&#8217;s theme JSON version three, so you need to look at the documentation that&#8217;s also been updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And you can also create and edit shadows in the global styles now. So there is a new control for that, but I must say I haven&#8217;t tested it, so I don&#8217;t really know how it works. But it&#8217;s great to see it, that you can create it in no code in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There will be in the global styles, there is now typography, and colors, and layouts, and now you also have a fourth one that&#8217;s called shadows. And then you can log all the things that you want to style on the shadow. It&#8217;s the color, it&#8217;s the angle, it&#8217;s the blur character and that. So you can really create your own styles, and it shows up on every block that supports box shadows, but it&#8217;s not all of them. And then there are presets as well that come in the natural, deep, sharp, so you can give them names as well, and add them to your global styles. So it&#8217;s the position, the blur, and the spread, and outside range set on the shadow. So they will show up with the core shadows, unless you disable the core shadows through the same JSON. So it&#8217;s not entirely, you cannot do this through the interface, but yeah, you can definitely create some nice shadows. It&#8217;s almost as good as gradients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I like all these design tools that you can use. So the block style variations mechanism is now extended, so you can do section styling. I think we mentioned a similar PR earlier today, but you can create sections, and then you can do block style variations for that. Oh yeah, we did this, that you can apply certain styles to multiple blocks. Now you can create sections, and then attach block styles for that. I think we should have better naming conventions, but it&#8217;s what we have right now. We need to make sure, because we have the style variations, we have block style variations, then we have section styling. It&#8217;s all kind of getting a little bit convoluted, complex, but we&#8217;ll figure it all out. I&#8217;m definitely sure that once everything is in place, we can combine it and do it how we need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: And so, the next feature is block bindings, and especially the block bindings panel that is now added to the block inspector. So when you bind certain attributes from the block to the post meta, and then they will show up in the block inspector in the site panel, so that you&#8217;ll know which attributes are connected to the meta. So I think this is really nice, because you get to see what is connected. And before, I think it was only, you can only tell it is binded by the violet like icon, or something like that, by the color, but there was no way of telling what is connected to what. So yeah, that&#8217;s definitely an improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely an improvement. Yeah. Yeah, the icon was that kind of connector icon in purple on the block toolbar, but you only could see that per block. But the bindings panel, you see all the pieces, all the data that is connected to that block. And where it also tells you, because you can, for the block bindings, you can assign custom data sources. So it also adds the data source to the inspector controls. So you know okay, this comes from post meta, this comes from another data source, so that&#8217;s nice too. I really like it. And they also, that comes together with that, allow editing of the post meta source. So if you have a URL somewhere or an additional data point in the block, you can actually change it there. And it&#8217;s also then updated in the post meta table that comes with it. They didn&#8217;t put in a nice video or so they used to do it with the PRs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here it is. So now you can edit in the block canvas, change the data, and then it will be updated also throughout every block that uses that metadata for that particular post item. So if you have that binding also for the archive templates, it&#8217;ll also be updated in the archive templates, wherever that particular post meta is showing up. So that&#8217;s a pretty cool feature. I think that is something that was never possible with WordPress until this time, that you can actually have additional custom fields be edited through core. You always needed a plugin for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most developers went with advanced custom fields, but there are also others that allow you that. It&#8217;s certainly not as rich as advanced custom fields. So you can&#8217;t do field groups and all that, but it definitely gets there sooner or later. And I really like it. Yeah, it&#8217;s really cool. That can be, it also an answer to what happens to all the meta boxes that were on the bottom of the screen. So if you bind them to a block, then you don&#8217;t have to create a custom block for that. You just need to create the binding for it. So I think it gets there where a lot of people wanted the block editor to be in year two. Well we are in year, year seven, but they needed a lot of other things to come in place before this happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: But this is such a powerful API, the block bindings API. It&#8217;s also one of the most important APIs that are coming to WordPress right now. And it&#8217;s worth mentioning and it&#8217;s worth getting interested in that and learning how to use it. Especially if we build with blocks, we don&#8217;t really want to have these meta boxes on the bottom of the editor. So this is a great way to get rid of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And also, for plugin developers, that they don&#8217;t need to go through all the hoops to create blocks for some of the things that they could do just in block bindings. There are two articles on the developer blog, one part one and part two, where the block binding has been a tutorial on using the block binding API. And I will share the links to those in the show notes. So Justin Tadlock had one that says, building a review site with block bindings. And the part one covers the custom fields and block variations. Part two will be released later in a couple of days. And that is about how to actually create input things in the inspector controls. So it&#8217;s kind of a predecessor. So if you don&#8217;t want to wait for WordPress six to come out, you can use that variation, but sometimes it might be just more user-friendly to use those inspector controls and control them yourselves, rather than use what comes from the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we need to find a way if we could actually switch them off at some point. So I&#8217;ll share those articles in the show notes of this podcast. All right, again, a lot of documentation went in this release documentation, updates in this release, it&#8217;s all about components and blocks, and I think they updated the JSON docs for a lot of components. So they actually are automatically graded from for the documentation. So I think these are the changes for that. Check them out. All right. Wow, this was a long show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s probably about an hour. So I think we come to an end of this show. Magdalena, thank you so much for being here and going through this with me. Explained quite a few things that I didn&#8217;t understand. So I&#8217;m really happy that you joined me today. When people wanted to reach you or connect with you, what would be a good place to catch up with you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: I think the best place would be on LinkedIn, because that&#8217;s what I use as social media. I&#8217;m not that active on social media, not like I&#8217;m everywhere. But yeah, if you reach me out on LinkedIn, then I&#8217;ll get the message. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So I&#8217;m going to share that information as well in the show notes. Is there anything else that you want our listeners to know about your company, or your presentations, or there&#8217;s an article coming out, I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Magdalena Paciorek</em>: Yeah. Well, I need to start writing, but I would like to invite everyone to my talk at WordCamp Europe, happening next week. I&#8217;ll be covering some of the things that we&#8217;ve talked about today, like pattern overrides or block bindings. And also, I&#8217;ll be sharing some of my, I don&#8217;t know, experiments also that I&#8217;ve done with Gutenberg with custom blocks. So I hope this will serve as inspiration of how we might create post types in the future. Maybe we could actually create them now in this new way, a new block way, block editor way, not in the custom fields way we used to do, or how it&#8217;s still popular to create them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this talk, I think it&#8217;s mainly, I&#8217;ve made it for people who build websites for clients, so like agencies and freelancers that maybe want to take a look at how you could build this typical for agency websites, in the new approach, like you build it with blocks, with some custom code as well, but in a different way that you would do it with, for example, ACF. So yeah, so I invite everyone. I&#8217;ll be talking I think in the morning on Saturday, on the second day of WordCamp. So I see you in Torino. I&#8217;m super excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah. And I&#8217;m definitely going to be there, unless it&#8217;s Saturday, I need to see, I&#8217;m seeing on track one, so I&#8217;m not quite sure if I&#8217;m going to be there. But I will definitely catch it on the rerun through the live stream video. And I will share that also on that particular single post on the Gutenberg times about the WordCamp Europe. So yeah, and I&#8217;ll see everybody who is going to be in Europe and in Turin next week, and I hear the others on the next Gutenberg Changelog podcast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as always, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, a new fun, exciting event happening at WordCamp Europe next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcasts players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, well, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Jamie Marsland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie runs a WordPress plugin business, and has recently become a full-time content creator on YouTube. You might know Jamie from his popular WordPress speed builds on that channel, where contestants have just 30 minutes to build a website from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we dive into Jamie&#8217;s involvement with WordCamp Europe, where he&#8217;ll be bringing this speed build format to the live stage. Contestants will race against the clock to recreate a prebuilt website, all while being interrupted with questions from Jamie and the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie shares how this concept evolved from his own website recreations, and how it quickly gained popularity within the WordPress community. He talks about the insights and feedback that both participants and viewers have gained from these speed builds, making it more than just a fun challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the technical aspects of the competition, including what tools and plugins are allowed, and how the time constraints add both pressure and excitement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie discusses the importance of bringing more interactive and engaging content to WordCamp events, hoping to make them more dynamic and participatory in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end we talk about how these speed builds can bring a fresh perspective to the WordPress community, potentially attracting a younger, more diverse audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re attending WordCamp Europe, or you&#8217;re just curious about how WordPress can be made fun and engaging, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Jamie Marsland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast again by Jamie Marsland. How you doing, Jamie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:12] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Good morning. I&#8217;m very good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are one of the few people that I&#8217;ve had back on, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had anybody back on quite as quickly as you are. But this is time sensitive, which is not often the case because we&#8217;re going to be talking about something which is going to be featuring in WordCamp Europe, which is happening in the next few days, actually it&#8217;s about 10 days out. Something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to just introduce yourself to those people who haven&#8217;t come across you before? Although that is now a dying breed of people, I suspect. But do you want to introduce yourself, and give us a little bit of background to this particular topic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Sure. I&#8217;m Jamie and I run a WordPress plugin business, and that&#8217;s all I do. Oh, and occasionally I do some YouTube videos now, and YouTube&#8217;s kind of taken over. I&#8217;m pretty much full-time content creator, but I do have a plugin business as well. So go and check that out if you&#8217;re listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve been running these WordPress speed builds on my YouTube channel, and I&#8217;ve run about four or five, I think, so far, where contestants get 30 minutes to basically build a website. So it&#8217;s fast and furious, loads of fun. We get loads of people on the live chat. We&#8217;ve had some real stars of the WordPress space on so far, and it&#8217;s coming to Word, WordCamp Europe next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you are going to be on the stage at WordCamp with, what, two contestants vying to build the exact same thing in a very confined amount of time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you basically put a website, a pre-built website from out there on the internet somewhere and say, okay, you&#8217;ve got 30 minutes to make that. Go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, exactly. They haven&#8217;t seen it. They see it when we see it on stage, and then they get five minutes to prep then we start the clock, they get 30 minutes to build it whilst at the same time being hassled by me asking lots of extraordinarily stupid questions, and we get people from the crowd asking questions as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got to build it while actually commentating on what they&#8217;re doing, whilst getting lots of questions from people as well. So it&#8217;s high pressure. It&#8217;s a great format. It&#8217;s a really short and sharp thing to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So did you initially do it as just a bit of fun to create some content and then unexpectedly realized there was some pearls of wisdom to be gained from it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:21] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, the inspiration came from, &#8217;cause I did, on my YouTube channel for a while, I&#8217;ve been doing website recreations. I&#8217;ve done about 10 or 15 or something. Famous websites I recreate in half an hour. So I&#8217;ve been doing it myself and my channel, just me. And I thought actually this, would be a great format if you had two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It just popped in my head one day. You put two people actually competing to build exactly the same website in 30 minutes. So I put a tweet out just to gauge, as often do, gauge interest and people were really interested in it. And then I approached Brian Coords and Mike McAllister, two good friends of mine, to see whether they&#8217;d be willing to be the first on the show, and they agreed. They were amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we&#8217;ve run about five, I think, so far, with some really famous people in the WordPress space. But it is a very fun format, deliberately fun, and aimed at being fun. But the feedback I&#8217;m getting, especially from people in the WordPress product space, like Ben Ritner from Kadence came on last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They find it really useful from a, just a stress testing, product user testing experience to do that. They&#8217;re finding real value in it, over and above just being a fun format. So it&#8217;s a really interesting space. And there&#8217;s lots of ideas I&#8217;ve got of where we could take it next as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you, give them the same WordPress version? What I mean by that is in the five minutes, are they allowed to go and install into their WordPress website a whole collection of plugins, which may make the job them a little bit more straightforward? Or is it vanilla WordPress, core blocks all the way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:47] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, no, they&#8217;re allowed to do whatever they like. So I do a little bit of prep for them. So for example, for Ben, I installed Kadence and Kadence Pro. Over and above that I don&#8217;t really want to install too much, but they&#8217;re allowed to go off and basically install anything that they like. There&#8217;s no limits on, they can go and use Bricks or Beaver Builder or Elementor, but obviously every time they go off and install a plugin that&#8217;s eating up into their time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a bit of a time penalty every time they want to do that. But there&#8217;s no limits. Once the clock starts, they can do whatever they like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I&#8217;m guessing you are not picking, for example, the Google homepage has got one search field and a logo. I&#8217;m guessing that you are trying to get them to do much more complicated things? Loops and all sorts of other things. Just describe the level of complexity. Are you deliberately trying to the most difficult website that you can manage? Lings Cars, for example?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:37] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Lings Cars is coming up at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, really?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:40] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely going to come up. Rich Tabor would be, Rich Is coming on this Thursday actually, as well as next week. I mean I just think seeing Rich Tabor with someone with such a defined and beautiful design aesthetic, taking on Lings Cars. It&#8217;s just got to happen at some point. I don&#8217;t think I can stop myself from that happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But you are picking a difficult website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:59] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I&#8217;m picking, what I&#8217;m trying to do is a combination of a few things. One famous, so people know it. That&#8217;s not always the case. But also there&#8217;ll be some challenging, and there&#8217;ll be some good learning for people watching it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not just 30 minutes of fun, although it is. Cause a lot of the feedback I get, after the 30 minutes is up, we ask the players to go into the back end of the sites and tell us how they built it. And people love that. They get lots of learning from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I try and choose sites which are visually beautiful and interesting, have some challenges, but also there&#8217;s going to be some really good learning for people as well. So those sort of combination of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously Lings Cars meets all those criteria anyway, so it&#8217;s right in the sweet spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If you haven&#8217;t come across the Lings Cars website, dear listener, please pause the podcast now. Just and Google it. Lings, L-I-N-G-S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:47] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> And actually, Lings Cars, has had a lot of people talking about it, because as a piece of design, it has some real. Like I was chatting to Tammie Lister about it the other day. People have written articles about Lings Cars, because it actually works as a piece of design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has enormous personality and there&#8217;s no other sites really like it, and it&#8217;s driving a lot of business to them. So, although I scoff about it, it is, as a piece of web design, it&#8217;s very effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s a full assault on the senses in every way, it really does demonstrate what&#8217;s possible on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:19] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> My accessibility friends don&#8217;t particularly think it&#8217;s great, but it has some issues on that regard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I would imagine. So, everybody that you&#8217;re putting against each other. There&#8217;s two people and there&#8217;s you sitting in the middle if you like, and they&#8217;re trying to do things as rapidly as possible. Now, presumably, a lot of muscle memory for them will come in, they&#8217;re just familiar with, okay, I can see that I need to lay out this, I need a sidebar here, and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you get to interrupt and say, wait, hang on, what happened just then? Or do you wait until the 30 minutes is up and then quiz them? Or are you allowed to say just repeat that little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:54] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I interrupt continually, &#8217;cause I think that&#8217;s quite interesting. And it puts more pressure on them. And we actually had Nick Diego on a few weeks ago, and he was at, he was answering questions from the live chat about what&#8217;s going on in core at the moment, which is just brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have this amazing idea that I think I&#8217;m going to introduce a bit more jeopardy. So halfway through the build, at some point I&#8217;m going to have a siren go off and it&#8217;s going to be a change spec request from the customer or something like that. We suddenly veer off in a different direction. Or the customer says, can you make the logo a little bit or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can you make it pop?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:25] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Can you make it pop? Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Essentially we&#8217;re giggling about this because it feels like a lot of fun. And I do wonder, the reason that you&#8217;ve brought it into WordCamp Europe, do you have an opinion about that in terms of, do you think that the events could do with livening up a little bit? I mean we all talk about how wonderful WordCamps are. I think it&#8217;s fair to say that of us enjoy them when we go there. But do you think they could do with a little bit of excitement, drama, gimmicks, whatever the word is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:52] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s not just WordCamp. I think all live events, it&#8217;s like worth thinking about, what can you bring to that event that you can&#8217;t watch online, that you can&#8217;t get if you&#8217;re just sitting at home in your office? And I think events like this, you want to be in the room for an event like this, because there&#8217;s going to be audience participation. To be in the room is going to be a different experience than watching it on your computer screen, because you can watch the live streams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think the more stuff we can bring that to WordCamps, because for me the real value of WordCamps is the people bit, you know, whether it&#8217;s inside or outside. And I think this is going to be highly interactive and fun. So I think, yeah, if we can do more stuff like this, which aren&#8217;t traditional kind of event type things, then that&#8217;d be great. That said, I have no idea how this is going to go. It might be a complete disaster, in which case, we&#8217;ll come back in a month and say, that was a really bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But you&#8217;re interested in filling up that room, and trying to get people involved. And, is it going to be a bit more pantomime than workshop? In other words, are you hoping that the crowd will, he&#8217;s behind you, that kind of thing? Are you hoping for people to be literally interjecting and yelling out, no, no, no, do it this way, that kind of thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:56] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. It&#8217;s been a fairly, because I pitched it in, I don&#8217;t know, about a month ago. So it&#8217;s been a fairly, we&#8217;re still working out some technical stuff with the technical team, but, yeah, there&#8217;s going to be music, I hope. And a big part of the online ones is that there&#8217;s a clock constantly ticking down, that people can see the whole 30 minutes, which just ramps up the pressure. So we need to have a big clock on stage and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But the technical aspects, so there&#8217;s going to be three people on the stage, your two contestants, for want of a better word, plus you. How is everybody going to be able to see what they&#8217;re doing? Are you going to have one big screen on one side, and one big screen on the other, showing what your two contestants are actually doing at that moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:32] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> To be decided, at the moment. The backstop is that we do it the same way that I do it online, which is I&#8217;m kind of operating, and I&#8217;m flicking back and forth between the screens. So if we had one screen, it still works, because we can just flick back and forth between, so we can see what Rich is doing, and what Jessica is doing at different times. So ideally we&#8217;d have two screens, but I&#8217;m not sure at the moment whether that&#8217;s technically going to be possible. But we&#8217;ll see. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just speak to the actual learning then, because obviously you started this, and it was a little bit of fun. But prior to clicking record, you&#8217;ve said that you&#8217;d had a few people on who did some fairly remarkable things. Not just in terms of the speed with which they could do it, but also presumably fairly creative. Have you managed to get actual learning out of it, not just purely entertainment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:16] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Do you mean me as a WordPress user?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, yeah. Do you feel like your audience are getting something, or does the format kind of lend itself more to entertainment and less to, I don&#8217;t know, introspection of what they were actually doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:28] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> There&#8217;s definitely more, if you&#8217;re going to have a pie chart, there&#8217;s definitely more entertainment than learning. The learning slice is relatively small, but there is a lot of learning. I was, watching, there was a great episode with Fabian and Kim Coleman, and they were incredibly quick, and a lot of that speed was through shortcuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I suddenly, in my personal WordPress usage, I&#8217;m now using a lot of shortcuts, and that has saved me a whole bunch of time. The last one was Justin Tadlock and Ben Ritner from Kadence, and they were building the Rolling Stone website. There was quite a lot of complexity in the grid layouts. A lot of people wouldn&#8217;t know that stuff, or the feedback I get, don&#8217;t know that stuff is possible, and so I think there&#8217;s loads of learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also loads of learning in terms of what&#8217;s possible in Core, and what&#8217;s possible in add-on plugins like Kadence. That was really interesting to see that direct comparison of Core can do this much, and it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s got a query loop block. But the Kadence query loop block is a lot more advanced. So if you really want to go advanced, then that&#8217;s an interesting comparison to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think there is lots of learning, and the feedback we get, because we do a washup after the half an hour is up, where we get the players to go into the front end and then the back end, and talk us through how they built it. I think that&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they also do is, they always say how they would&#8217;ve done it, not just how they did it, how they would&#8217;ve done it, or how they do it for clients. Because obviously there&#8217;s, nobody&#8217;s building sites in 30 minutes for clients. So there&#8217;s obviously a big gap between the way they do it on the show and the way they do it in their real life. So they&#8217;ll share that, you know, what they would&#8217;ve done, the purest way, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a bit like speed climbing, if you&#8217;ve ever watched that, where you&#8217;ve got the wall really, really, quickly, versus the purest sort of alpine climbing. It&#8217;s a bit like that. But there&#8217;s lots of value in a shorter format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, just being able to cram that in, and obviously get lots and lots done in a very short space of time, because you&#8217;re highly engaged and highly focused on it. And you&#8217;ve got the competition of beating your opponent. How has that all gone down? You know, because obviously you could get fairly, well, your ego could be wounded, let&#8217;s put it that way. You know, if you really reach a brick wall and you can&#8217;t figure out how to progress. Have you had any of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:20] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean, that&#8217;s one of the most amazing things. I&#8217;m completely in awe of everyone that comes on the show. Completely in awe, because we are having like 128 people watching live, you are a WordPress professional, and yet you are prepared to go on and give it a bash. I think that&#8217;s just an incredible, incredible thing to do. And so I come out and everyone&#8217;s done great so far. And even if they don&#8217;t do great, I think people are enthralled by watching people that will have a go. And the stuff they&#8217;re doing is just incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are people that like Ben Ritner&#8217;s the founder of Kadence. He&#8217;s got an incredibly successful business, and yet he&#8217;s coming on for 30 minutes of fun, and we are watching him build a site. And we&#8217;ve had lots of these people that are just the top of the game, like Nick Diego and Brian Coords, and Fabian, Kim, and a Rich Tabor this week. And Jonathan Jernigan, these people are like, these are serious WordPress people, and yet they&#8217;re prepared to come on, and be prepared to fail. Nobody has, but that&#8217;s an incredibly brave thing to do. So I&#8217;m completely in admiration of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you have a winner?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:15] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Well, maybe I should do. I haven&#8217;t yet. That was the idea. So in the first few I kind of got the people in the live chat to vote, but a lot of them were just voting for the people they liked. It was a bit like a popularity contest. At the moment it&#8217;s not necessary, because it doesn&#8217;t feel like there is needing to be a winner at the moment. And that&#8217;s not really the idea of it, I don&#8217;t think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that said, I can definitely see where I have a day of, like a world championships of speed building, where there is a sponsor, and there is a prize, and it gets a little bit more competitive. To be honest, I&#8217;m just kind of feeling my way in the format. Some people say the format&#8217;s too short, and I understand that viewpoint. But it&#8217;s short deliberately, because it&#8217;s half an hour of people&#8217;s time. It&#8217;s half an hour of fun. And I don&#8217;t want it to be, you know, people&#8217;s time is precious, and I think it&#8217;s good to have time pressure. But the format may change a little bit, but I don&#8217;t foresee it changing a lot of moment. But yeah, no, there&#8217;s no real winners at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you think WordPress, the ecosystem of WordPress, and I know that you think about this rather a lot, you know, how WordPress pitches itself into the marketplace of website building, amongst commercial competitors like Wix and Squarespace. Do you think WordPress needs something like this? Does it need a bit of a shot in the arm to make it a bit more fun, interesting, entertaining? Do you feel like projects like this give WordPress a bit of a boost, in a way that it may not have had otherwise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:32] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Oh, I hope so. I do think about this a lot, too much probably. My view on WordPress is it&#8217;s this incredibly beautiful, radical idea that was started 21 years ago, and yet some of the content doesn&#8217;t reflect that always, especially when it&#8217;s compared to its competitors. It&#8217;s almost like, I don&#8217;t want to be too harsh, but some of the content&#8217;s almost like local government type content, in a way. It&#8217;s quite dry and technical. So yeah, I think that there is definitely a space to create some more entertaining type, fun content around WordPress, which has kind of been the rationales of my channel anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think also we&#8217;re living in an era where, and I don&#8217;t actually have any statistics about this, but it feels like the demographics are skewed towards older rather than younger, in adoption of WordPress. And I don&#8217;t know what the throughput is of teenagers coming in and being interested by it, but in a generation brought up on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, where entertainment really does directly lead to interest in certain things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can just point to my own children and see, absolutely, the straight line that&#8217;s gone from the mobile phone, the silly video that they&#8217;ve watched, into something that they&#8217;re curious about in the real world. We do need things like that because, well, we have to engage them where they are, and if WordPress as a platform wishes to continue, I suspect we are going to have to do more of these kind of entertaining, interesting, engaging pieces of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:50] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> I mean there&#8217;s a shocking stat, which is, because I&#8217;m in a YouTube mastermind group with a few people, and generally the female demographic on YouTube runs about 10% of our audiences. Now, mine&#8217;s just gone up to 20%. If you compare that to, my guess is if you compare that to Wix, or Canva, I know Canva is running about 50% female audience, definitely users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just from a purely kind of selfish market point of view, WordPress has a big, and I&#8217;m not talking about equality here, I&#8217;m just talking about if you were trying to reach a market, WordPress has some big challenges in terms of its aging demographic, and its male, female split for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So tell us when it&#8217;s happening, because I suspect a few people listening to this. We&#8217;re going to try to push this out. It&#8217;ll come out hopefully before the event, but let&#8217;s just imagine a worst case scenario, I fail to do that, and it comes out after the event. But nevertheless, tell us what day it&#8217;s on, and if you are in Turin or Torino for WordCamp Europe, when is it happening? What time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:44] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Okay, yep. So we&#8217;re on June the 14th at 5:00 PM, and we&#8217;re in track three, which is hall one. So please everyone, come along, pack out the room. It&#8217;s going to be loads of fun to finish the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If this ends up being really, really popular, you are going to be the one event that nobody wants to be in the speaker lineup at the same time as. It would be a little bit like if we put you on at the same time as Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s closing address. You can be fairly confident that the, you know, lots of people are going to go in that direction, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:12] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> If it okay as well, I&#8217;m hoping that they&#8217;ll invite me on all the WordCamps around the world, and this will be part of the, I mean, wouldn&#8217;t that be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Part of the gimmick, yeah. Part of the infrastructure. That would be really nice. Okay, Jamie, we&#8217;ve managed to get to about 22 or three minutes there. Is there anything you want to add before we knock it on the head?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:27] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> We probably haven&#8217;t mentioned who&#8217;s actually on it, which is Rich Tabor and Jessica Lyschik, are going to be the two players. So again, an epic battle. We&#8217;ve got male, female, we&#8217;ve got Europe, USA. What else do you want in 45 minutes of fun?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Honestly, it sounds like real entertainment. I hope that it goes well, that there&#8217;s no technical gremlins, and that you manage to get through it all, and that it&#8217;s an enjoyable experience for you, as well as the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:52] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Honestly, there&#8217;s so many moving parts. It&#8217;s like juggling while trying to write a speech, and a lot going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, very best of luck. Congratulations for getting this into WordCamp, and hopefully you&#8217;ll do many more online in the near future too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:03] <strong>Jamie Marsland:</strong> Cool. Thank you.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Jamie Marsland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie runs a WordPress plugin business and has recently become a full-time content creator on YouTube. You might know Jamie from his popular WordPress speed builds on that channel, where contestants have just 30 minutes to build a website from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we dive into Jamie’s involvement with WordCamp Europe, where he will be bringing this speed build format to the live stage. Contestants will race against the clock to recreate a pre-built website, all while being interrupted with questions from Jamie and the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamie shares how this concept evolved from his own website recreations and how it quickly gained popularity within the WordPress community. He talks about the insights and feedback that both participants and viewers have gained from these speed builds, making it more than just a fun challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the technical aspects of the competition, including what tools and plugins are allowed, and how the time constraints add both pressure and excitement. Jamie discusses the importance of bringing more interactive and engaging content to WordCamp events, hoping to make them more dynamic and participatory in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we talk about how these speed builds can bring a fresh perspective to the WordPress community, potentially attracting a younger, more diverse audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re attending WordCamp Europe or you&#8217;re just curious about how WordPress can be made fun and engaging, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/\">Jamie&#8217;s plugin business</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/JamieMarsland/videos\">Jamie&#8217;s YouTube Channel</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/kadence-blocks/\">Kadence Blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bricksbuilder.io/\">Bricks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/\">Beaver Builder</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lingscars.com/\">Lings Cars website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2024/session/gutenberg-speed-build-challenge/\">Gutenberg Speed Build Challenge: A Web Design Duel!</a> at WordCamp Europe 2024</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Gravatar: Maximize Engagement with Profile Page Design\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1496\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/05/user-profile-page-examples/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20154:\"<p>Everyone is unique, and our uniqueness is what makes the internet a great (admittedly, sometimes wild!) place. One way users can express individuality on your site is through profile pages, which gives them control over their online information and presentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When designing user profiles for your websites or web apps, it&#8217;s important to create a clean and user-friendly design. Profile pages are the first point of interaction, setting the tone for the overall experience. A well-designed profile page enhances user satisfaction by providing easy navigation and interaction. It also boosts retention rates by making users feel valued and understood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s explore the important elements of a well-designed profile page, check out some examples, and see how <a href=\"https://gravatar.com/\">Gravatar</a> can make things easier!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Essential components of your website’s profile page design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Profile picture or avatar</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Upload a profile picture\" class=\"wp-image-1499\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing users to upload a profile picture is the easiest and most basic way to start a profile page. A profile picture lets someone establish their identity on your website and helps users feel more connected to the platform and each other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain consistency, provide guidelines for acceptable image sizes and resolutions. For example, a standard size of 400&#215;400 pixels at 72 DPI is usually sufficient. Ensure content is relevant and follows community standards. A reporting system can create a safe and respectful environment instead of approving profile pictures one by one. This method combines effective moderation with community empowerment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Name and username</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"428\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-1.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Insert your own name\" class=\"wp-image-1500\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Deciding whether to display the user&#8217;s real name, username, or both is an important aspect of profile page design. This decision impacts personal branding and privacy. For instance, using real names can enhance authenticity, which is beneficial for professional networking. On the other hand, usernames might be better for privacy, making them suitable for social or gaming communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implement validation rules to make sure usernames are appropriate, unique, and memorable. Consider constraints like minimum and maximum character limits, prohibition of offensive terms, and the inclusion of alphanumeric characters only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Allow usernames like LucyMcMuppet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/274e.png\" alt=\"❎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Prevent usernames like LucyXoXoMcMup&lt;3</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bio section</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"426\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-2.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Bio section \" class=\"wp-image-1501\" />\n\n\n\n<p>A bio section allows users to introduce themselves, share their interests, or provide a brief professional background. This section adds a personal touch and can be a great way to build connections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To maintain consistency and readability, consider implementing character limits (e.g., 150-300 characters) and providing basic formatting options like bold or italic text. This ensures bios are concise and informative without overwhelming the reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interests or skills</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Including fields for users to list their interests, skills, or expertise enhances the social aspect of your platform by facilitating connections based on common interests. Implement a system that allows users to select from predefined categories or add custom tags to their profiles. This helps users express themselves and makes it easier for others to find and connect with them based on shared interests or skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Contact information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"660\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://blog.gravatar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-3.jpeg?w=660\" alt=\"Contact information button\" class=\"wp-image-1502\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Allow users to provide contact information, such as an email address or social media handles, to enable communication and networking opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, users should be able to choose whether their email is visible to everyone, only to connections, or kept private. This flexibility helps users feel secure and in control of their information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Other design elements to make your user profile pages stand out</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating various elements can significantly enhance user experience and engagement when designing user profile pages. However, it&#8217;s important to note that these features are unnecessary for <em>every </em>profile template. Choosing to incorporate them depends on the specific kind of website you&#8217;re building and the level of interaction between users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Work information</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporating sections for users to show their professional experience, skills, and achievements adds depth to user profiles. Features like timelines, bullet points, or multimedia elements make work history engaging and easy to read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timelines help visualize career progression, while bullet points highlight skills and achievements succinctly. Multimedia elements, such as videos or project images, provide a richer context and make profiles more dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Verified accounts and essential links</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Giving users the choice to show badges or indicators for verified accounts boosts credibility and trust. Verification can involve confirming emails or integrating with social media accounts. For instance, users can link their profile to their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/?lang=en\">X/Twitter</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning\">LinkedIn</a> accounts, which helps verify their identity through these established platforms. This assures other users of their authenticity and adds an extra level of security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a system for users to include significant links, such as personal websites, portfolios, or relevant external resources. Using icons or logos to represent various types of links or verified accounts ensures they are easily recognizable and visually appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Customization options</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Customization options allow users to personalize the look and feel of their profile pages, increasing their sense of ownership and satisfaction. Let users choose color schemes, layouts, or background images while ensuring these options align with your website&#8217;s overall branding and design guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Multimedia elements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Incorporate features that let users display their work, portfolios, or media files directly on their profile pages. This is particularly valuable for creative professionals who want to display their projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure that these multimedia elements are optimized for fast display and loading times to maintain a smooth user experience. Use responsive design principles to ensure that multimedia content looks good on all devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Privacy and security settings</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/newsroom/press-kits/2022-norton-cyber-safety-insights-report-special-release-online-creeping/\">85% of adults</a> worldwide eager to take additional steps in protecting their online privacy, it’s important to ensure that settings are in place so users can control the visibility of their contact details. Implement granular privacy settings that enable users to control the visibility of their profile information to different user groups or the public.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow best practices for data security and privacy to protect user information. This includes using secure protocols for data transmission, regularly updating your security measures, and being transparent about data use policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of websites with stunning user profile page design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for some inspiration for beautifully designed user profiles, these websites are great examples.

By taking user profile design seriously, you can create a more personalized and immersive experience for your users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By integrating Gravatar, you can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Centralize profile management</strong>: Users can manage their profile information in one place, and updates are reflected wherever their Gravatar is used.

Seems simple enough, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if you’ve spent any time trying to make this work, you’ve discovered it’s not so simple. People have become quite familiar with filling out online forms. And, they’ve become more wary about giving away their information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Those two realities need to guide your thoughts and decisions about how to create and use lead generation forms on your website. People today are more suspicious about online activity than they were 15 years ago, and they are more demanding of what a “good” lead generation form will do and how it will&nbsp;work.</p>\n\n<p>The good news is, companies and website owners also have access to at least two decades of A/B testing data on thousands of websites, plus lots of real&#8209;world experience. So we’ve learned a few things, and there’s a robust body of knowledge about how to create high&#8209;converting lead generation forms. When implemented correctly, these tactics minimize the number of people who turn away for avoidable&nbsp;reasons.</p>\n\n<p>With that in mind, let’s look at 25 lead generation form best&nbsp;practices.</p>\n\n\n<span id=\"more-283968\"></span>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-keep-it-short-and simple\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Keep it short and&nbsp;simple</h2>\n\n\n<p>Short is good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And short applies to all aspects of the lead generation form. Fewer fields to fill out makes for a shorter form. Less text in the headline makes the form look shorter, and makes it easier to digest in a single glance. Shorter call-to-action buttons tend to work better than longer ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there’s more to all of these aspects than just the length. Testing matters. The point here is, only include in your form what you need to include. Cut the excess. Trim the fat. Discard the non-essentials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>In other words, keep it simple. Short is good. Simple is better. Sometimes simple might mean a slightly longer lead generation form. But whatever results in the easiest possible user experience is probably the better way to&nbsp;go.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Use a benefit&#8209;oriented&nbsp;headline</h2>\n\n<p>The worst kinds of headlines on lead generation forms say some variation of&nbsp;this:</p>\n\n<p>“Join our newsletter!” The exclamation point isn’t going to make the difference&nbsp;here.</p>\n\n<p>In all seriousness, if the rest of your website is doing its job, some people will join your email list and fill out your forms even with a generic headline like this. But more people will respond if you write a headline on your form that provides a benefit for filling it&nbsp;out.</p>\n\n<p>Some companies hear this, and they change their headline to “Join our newsletter to stay updated,” or “Get the latest news — join our email&nbsp;list.”</p>\n\n<p>You can do&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n\n<p>What are the real benefits to filling out your form? Since most forms connect people to your email list, we’re using that as the example for most of these tips. But some forms have other purposes, like registering for a webinar, getting notified when a new product’s released, or becoming a member.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Whatever the purpose of your lead generation form, spell out a key benefit in the headline. Promise something your target audience will want. For&nbsp;example:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Stay ahead of the stock gurus when you join our&nbsp;newsletter</li>\n\n<li>Become a master gardener with weekly&nbsp;emails</li>\n\n\n<li>Get exclusive email-only deals&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>You can also include the benefit in the name of your newsletter. Give your email subscriber list a cool name that will resonate with your target audience. It’s no longer just your “email list” or “newsletter” anymore. Now, it’s The Market Leader’s Daily Tips, The Weekly Green Thumb, or the VIP Insider&nbsp;Track.</p>\n\n\n<p>Those are just quick examples, of course. You can probably do even better. But your target audience will respond more favorably and in greater numbers to a cleverly-named email list. It feels more unique, tailored to them, original, desirable, established, and credible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-include-a-clear-value proposition\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Include a clear value&nbsp;proposition</h2>\n\n\n<p>The value proposition is similar to a benefit, except now it’s one of your foundational attractions to your target customers and leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You’re promising to solve a problem they care about, answer questions that matter to them, or deliver an outcome they desire, and you’re doing this by spelling out exactly what they get for filling out your&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n\n<p>One great way to do this is to offer something tangible in exchange for joining your email list. This could be a PDF like an eBook or a special report that delivers an instant reward of great value. It could be a special coupon or offer for new customers. Find something your target audience desires, and give it to them as a reward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also make a promise, without taking it too far. For example, Get Daily Writing Tips to Become a Best-Selling Author.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that example, the value proposition is right in the headline —&nbsp;it’s the thing that your target audience wants most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If it’s a webinar, specify that signing up reserves their spot, and include a core value proposition that the webinar will deliver. If it’s a free course, say when they have access to the course. If it’s a coupon, say when the coupon becomes active — “Sign up and save 20%&nbsp;instantly”.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Feature action&#8209;oriented&nbsp;language</h2>\n\n<p>If you look back over the examples from the previous sections, you’ll notice lots of active&nbsp;verbs:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sign up</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stay ahead</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Become</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You want your leads to do something, take action, seize the moment, grab the benefit, take a chance, be the first. Action-oriented language is more compelling, especially in your call-to-action buttons, but also in your headlines and subheadings if you use one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-use-contrasting colors\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Use contrasting&nbsp;colors</h2>\n\n<p>So far, we’ve been talking mostly about the text and content, as well as the offer you’re making to your prospects when they fill out your lead generation&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<p>But design matters, too. Contrasting colors get more attention than colors that blend in with the rest of your website. Online forms have become commonplace, and it’s very, very easy to gloss over them and not even notice. They blend in with the background noise we’re all used to&nbsp;seeing.</p>\n\n\n<p>Your lead generation forms need to stand out from the surrounding colors. You may have rarely used, but still approved, accent brand colors in your guidelines. This is the time to use them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6-avoid captcha\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Avoid&nbsp;CAPTCHA</h2>\n\n<p>CAPTCHA is a form&#8209;conversion destroyer. <a href=\"https://medium.com/rareview/why-your-captcha-is-killing-conversions-f9be6fe17d1f\">One study found</a> that an astonishing 30% of visitors abandon lead generation forms because of&nbsp;CAPTCHA.</p>\n\n\n<p>That’s serious short-term revenue if your lead generation tool incentivizes an immediate purchase. And it’s serious long-term revenue if your leads turn into repeat customers with high lifetime value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, you don’t want hordes of bots and scammers filling out your forms and gumming up your database with non-leads. That just annoys your sales team, when they first glance at the database and see 200 new leads, only to discover that 160 of them are spammers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>A better&nbsp;way?</p>\n\n<p>Use<a href=\"https://akismet.com/features/\"> Akismet, a frictionless solution</a> that blocks spam form submissions using an ever&#8209;growing AI&#8209;guided database of IP addresses, email addresses, words, and names. To date, this powerful <a href=\"https://akismet.com/blog/captcha-alternatives/\">alternative to CAPTCHA technology</a> has blocked over 500 billion spam submissions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7.png\" alt=\"stats about Akismet spam\" class=\"wp-image-283970\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Plans are <a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">competitively priced</a> (especially when you understand their instant positive impact on your bottom line) and Akismet also has an <a href=\"https://akismet.com/enterprise/\">enterprise version</a> for larger companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7-include-social proof\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Include social&nbsp;proof</h2>\n\n\n<p>Remember, you want to keep your lead generation forms short and simple. But you also want people to fill them out. Social proof is a powerful tool because it motivates and reassures at the same time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>For lead generation forms, the best testimonials will be short sentences, even just a few words or excerpts from longer ones. And as for placement, they work best near the call to action (CTA) button. Anyone hovering in that area has filled out the form and is now deciding whether to actually click the&nbsp;button.</p>\n\n\n<p>Effective social proof can help push them to take action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8-add-trust signals\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Add trust&nbsp;signals</h2>\n\n\n<p>With so much spam and cybercrime, establishing trust online has become harder. There are some trust signals you can employ that reassure potential leads that you are a legitimate business or organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The most common trust signals include security certifications and noticeable privacy&nbsp;policies.</p>\n\n\n<p>A security certification is typically just the logo of whatever online security or malware protection service you might be using. Most such services include a logo as part of their service for exactly this reason, and because it serves as marketing for them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>And privacy policies serve as a confirmation that your company cares about the data of customers and leads. Few people will read your policy, so for most leads, the mere display of one accomplishes the goal of increasing trust in the reliability of your lead generation&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Ensure&nbsp;mobile&#8209;friendliness</h2>\n\n\n<p>By this point in the digital age, this should go without saying. But make sure your lead generation forms look right and function well on mobile devices. In addition, make sure the web pages on which they appear function, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You need the lead gen form to show up on the mobile device in the appropriate place and at the appropriate time. It is a featured asset, not just background. It should not be possible to miss&nbsp;it.</p>\n\n\n<p>So make sure your forms show up and can be easily filled out and navigated on mobile devices.&nbsp; Test this. Once your form is up, get on a variety of mobile devices and see if it’s working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"10-minimize distractions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Minimize&nbsp;distractions</h2>\n\n\n<p>The form itself is a “content sanctuary.” Only vital and relevant text or imagery should be allowed in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the areas near your form should also be guarded closely. Busy websites with tons of features can be okay, but the form should not be buried in the midst of other content and widgets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you may have sections on your website with testimonials, screenshots, videos, photos, and text boxes. You might be using tables to compare the features of your various plans and products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are not the place for your lead generation forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The form needs to break the flow of whatever else is on the web page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a sidebar, don’t make the form just one of many things on the sidebar. Make it the only thing, at least in that section of the sidebar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to put forms in the middle of blog articles and web pages, don’t wrap the text around the form. Make the form the featured and centered item wherever it appears.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is — make it impossible to miss. Yes, some visitors and potential leads will ignore your forms, but at least make sure they’ll see them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"11-use-descriptive labels\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. Use descriptive&nbsp;labels</h2>\n\n\n<p>Make sure the labels for your form fields are clear and accurate. ‘First name’ is probably better than ‘First’, for example.&nbsp; Yes, most people know what the single word means, but you have to remember that the internet is for everyone. You have people from all sorts of educational backgrounds, all languages, and countries all over the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Your target audience plays a role in this, of course, but when in doubt, it’s best to be clear and not invite any confusion or uncertainty into the process of filling out lead generation&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n\n<p>And make sure it’s clear which label applies to which field. It’s better to put the label next to the form field, rather than above or below it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. Utilize a single&#8209;column&nbsp;layout</h2>\n\n<p>It’s been generally accepted for a while that single&#8209;column forms work better than two&#8209;column forms.<a href=\"https://www.foxit.com/blog/elements-of-good-form-design-single-column-beats-multi-column-forms/\"> Studies like this one</a> have found that single&#8209;column forms get completed much faster. Quicker form completion implies higher&nbsp;conversions.</p>\n\n<p>So, when in doubt, use single column&nbsp;forms.</p>\n\n\n<p>However, just about any lead generation form best practice needs to be taken with this caveat: Test everything to be sure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example,<a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/one-vs-two-column-form-conversion-test\"> this HubSpot study</a> details their own experience with switching to a two-column form. When they tested it, the two-column version got higher conversions. But the likely reason for this is that their form is quite long.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The single column version looks much longer and thus probably intimidated more people from filling it out. The two&#8209;column one can be more easily seen in its entirety. With shorter forms, single&#8209;column should outperform two&#8209;column almost every&nbsp;time.</p>\n\n<p>However, on mobile devices, two&#8209;column forms are more difficult to make work because of spacing, so your form needs to be well&#8209;designed and tested for all screen formats. Interestingly, Hubspot later altered their form to include elements of both one and two&#8209;column&nbsp;formats.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"13-minimize-mandatory fields\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Minimize mandatory&nbsp;fields</h2>\n\n\n<p>Every lead generation form has a purpose. If you’re just collecting email addresses and trying to build your list, you don’t need very many forms&nbsp;because you can collect more information about your subscribers through additional marketing offers. You can qualify leads over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other companies prefer to get more information up front to save themselves the trouble of having huge lists with mostly unprofitable leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In either situation, you want to try to minimize the number of mandatory fields. What do you really need to know, and what would it be nice to know? For the nice to know stuff, you might keep the field in your form, but consider making it non-mandatory. That way, leads who want to quickly move through your form can do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, do you need a last name? In some cases you do, but in many, you don’t. It might be nice to have, but it’s definitely asking more of a lead to divulge that information than just their first name. Do you really need a country or a city? Do you really need both a home and work phone number?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reduce your form fields, and your form will get filled out by more leads because it will be less intimidating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"14-avoid dropdowns\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Avoid&nbsp;dropdowns</h2>\n\n\n<p>Dropdown menus have a host of problems, which have been exposed through a<a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/drop-down-usability\"> series of studies</a> on the topic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With long dropdown menus, such as country selections, you can’t see all the options, and it can be difficult to scroll through the list since every device works differently. The experience often frustrates users, and they end up skipping it altogether.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>With short dropdown menus, the question becomes, why not just offer radio buttons&nbsp;instead?</p>\n\n<p>You can see all the choices and just pick the one you want. On a mobile device in particular, dropdowns are much more difficult to navigate than simple radio&nbsp;choices.</p>\n\n\n<p>And for countries, the study recommends just using an autocomplete field. As the user begins typing their country, possible matches will quickly narrow down to the obvious choice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Dropdown menus are distracting, hard to navigate, and reduce the quality of the user experience. None of that can be good for your conversion&nbsp;rate.</p>\n\n<p>Opt for radio buttons, checkboxes, autocomplete fields, or just leaving that field off your&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"15-use-inline validation\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. Use inline&nbsp;validation</h2>\n\n\n<p>This is a surefire winner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inline validation isn’t a very appealing term, but it definitely does wonders for your conversion rates. Why? Because it shortens completion time, increases information accuracy, and makes your leads happier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.zuko.io/blog/inline-validation-in-online-forms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">One study</a> of inline validation found a 22% decrease in form field errors, a 31% increase in satisfaction, and a 42% drop in completion times, among other benefits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>What is inline&nbsp;validation?</p>\n\n\n<p>It’s a tool that detects if information a user has entered is probably incorrect. For example, putting two @ symbols in your email address, or a phone number with an extra digit can be detected by inline validation software. A note shows up in the form, telling the user they may have made a mistake.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>You can see why this would reduce errors, but why does it decrease completion&nbsp;time?</p>\n\n<p>Because the alternative form of validation is to wait until the form is all filled out, and then hit them with a bunch of red marks pointing out the fields that aren’t correct. Now, they have to revisit them all, which takes much more time, and is a frustrating experience that brings back memories of red ink in your&nbsp;schoolwork.</p>\n\n\n<p>Plus, if you’re using multistep forms, having to go back several steps to correct errors is cumbersome and frustrating.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Inline validation eliminates most of these problems, making the whole experience of completing a web form easier and better for&nbsp;everyone.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"16-activate autofill\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. Activate&nbsp;autofill</h2>\n\n\n<p>This was mentioned earlier, but it qualifies as its own lead generation form best practice. The reason is again because of the time it saves the user. Autofill lets you input common information that shows up frequently or is associated with other information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>If the user is new to the website, you can still autofill things like the email mailbox such as ‘yahoo.com.’ Once they type in the @ and the ‘ya’, you know what the rest will likely be. Autofill accelerates the process for fields with characteristics like this. And it can even work for fields with information unique to your&nbsp;website.</p>\n\n\n<p>For instance, a form could ask its leads what kind of car they drive. There are only so many makes and models, and autofill can accelerate the process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Autofill can also work for visitors who have been to your site before (or have stored, and allow access to, certain information saved in their browser). It can fill in their information, such as cities, zip codes, and phone numbers, saving them lots of time tediously filling these out again and again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Autofill will speed up form completion, and it will also increase form conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"17-use-progress indicators\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Use progress&nbsp;indicators</h2>\n\n\n<p>Especially for multistep forms, the progress indicator bar across the top of the form builds momentum for the user as they see it get closer and closer to the other side. Humans like closure. We like finishing things. It feels faster when you can see the visual effect of your progress reacting in real-time to what you’re doing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1474\" height=\"1318\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8.png\" alt=\"example of progress bars\" class=\"wp-image-283971\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Users think, “I’m already this far along, no reason to quit now”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"18-switch-to-multistep-forms-for-longer processes\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">18. Switch to multistep forms for longer&nbsp;processes</h2>\n\n\n<p>We’ve brought up multistep forms a few times already. For longer forms, especially combined with progress bars, this approach tends to work much better because it simplifies the experience of filling out a form by breaking it down into manageable steps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of a form with 20 fields, the user can fill out five smaller forms with just four fields each. It’s much less intimidating because each step requires just a few items. And with the progress bar, the whole experience feels faster than if you had to do it all in one form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>Plus, with mobile devices, you can’t even see the entire form on your screen if it’s too long. That makes it even harder to tell how much more you have to do. And the scrolling invites usability frustrations. But with a multistep form on mobile, you can see the entire form for each step, the whole way&nbsp;through.</p>\n\n\n<p>One site<a href=\"https://instapage.com/blog/multi-step-form-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> discussed here</a> increased its conversion rate from 11% to 46% when they switched from a single form to a multistep form. If you have a long lead generation form, that ought to get your attention and motivate you to make this change immediately.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"19-highlight-the-benefit-in-the cta\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">19. Highlight the benefit in the&nbsp;CTA</h2>\n\n\n<p>Returning to your lead generation form copy, the text you use for the CTA button should be carefully chosen. Don’t settle for bland and overused calls to action like “submit”, “join now”, or “subscribe today!” Again, the exclamation point doesn’t help such a cliché CTA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your lead generation form is making a promise and asking people to do something — reveal personal information and enter your circle of influence. They’re opting in to receive marketing from you, and they know it. That’s not a small thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With action-oriented, benefit-focused CTA button copy, you can make them feel great about the decision to click that button and engage with your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>The earlier tip about action&#8209;oriented language applies here too, except with buttons — try to keep the text brief. You can also personalize the button text with first person language, so the reader puts themselves in the situation. Here are some examples of great CTA button&nbsp;copy:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Get my free&nbsp;report</li>\n\n<li>I’m in! Send my VIP access&nbsp;code</li>\n\n<li>Grab your&nbsp;coupons</li>\n\n<li>Gain access to exclusive&nbsp;deals</li>\n\n<li>Stake my&nbsp;claim</li>\n\n<li>Start your subscription&nbsp;today</li></ul>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"20-incentivize-immediate action\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">20. Incentivize immediate&nbsp;action</h2>\n\n\n<p>Within your forms, either in the CTA button, the headline, the subhead if any, or perhaps a phrase right below the button, do what you can to add urgency to your form. So many website visitors never return again, so this is your only chance to capture most of the people who will see your lead generation forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no reason to be timid about it. Offer a limited time special, free bonus, or valuable promise. Use language like now, today, immediately, and right away. There’s no reason to wait&nbsp;because waiting will mean, most likely, never.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"21-ensure-form accessibility\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">21. Ensure form&nbsp;accessibility</h2>\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is all about ensuring that all potential leads, regardless of any impairments or cognitive differences, can interact with your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, there are far more people with some sort of visual impairment than you may realize. About<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2800246\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> a quarter of U.S. adults</a> over the age of 71 have some sort of impairment. In many of these cases, text on screen becomes harder to read or colors may blend together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So ensure your forms work with screen readers. Consult color contrast guides and make sure your page complies. Enlarge the text on your page, label form fields appropriately, and use helpful alt text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, look to <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the WCAG</a> for accessibility guidelines that aim for everyone to use your site to its full potential and become a quality lead.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"22-boost-page-load times\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">22. Boost page load&nbsp;times</h2>\n\n\n<p>Improving page speed always helps website engagement, including with your lead generation forms. The longer it takes for your pages to load, the more people will abandon the site. And mobile tends to be slower than desktop for many sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a tool like<a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Page Speed Insights</a> to find out what you can do to speed up your website, for both desktop and mobile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"823\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9.png\" alt=\"Jetpack Boost homepage\" class=\"wp-image-283972\" />\n\n\n<p>WordPress sites can turn to <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/boost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jetpack Boost</a> for near instant performance analysis and automatic&nbsp;improvements.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">23. Offer real&#8209;time assistance via live&nbsp;chat</h2>\n\n<p>For website visitors who get stuck on some part of your form but are motivated to fill it out, having a live chat service can bridge the gap and be the difference between a potential lead filling out your form or walking&nbsp;away.</p>\n\n<p>If you have high website traffic, a service like this could make a big impact on your form conversion&nbsp;rates.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"24-optimize-the-confirmation page\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">24. Optimize the confirmation&nbsp;page</h2>\n\n<p>So far, everything you’ve seen here has involved the lead generation form itself. But lead generation doesn’t stop once someone fills out your form. That’s just the beginning. If you burn them out or turn them off the next day, no one&nbsp;benefits.</p>\n\n\n<p>You want to continue to deliver an excellent user experience from the moment the person has filled out your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It begins on the confirmation page. After a new lead has filled out your form, sustain the momentum by putting a lot of thought into the confirmation page. Too many lead generation forms just leave the default text in place, which is&nbsp;usually….awful.</p>\n\n<p>Switch that out for something better. A few&nbsp;suggestions:</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Thank them! This should be impossible to miss, right at the top of the confirmation&nbsp;page</li>\n\n<li>Reinforce the decision they just made to join your list by restating the benefit or promise they will&nbsp;receive</li>\n\n<li>Give any instructions they need to claim their benefit, get started, or take the next&nbsp;step</li>\n\n<li>Consider including an upsell right here and turn your new lead into a&nbsp;customer</li>\n\n<li>Include a link that takes them somewhere else on your site to keep them&nbsp;engaged</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you offered a lead magnet of some sort, that should be featured prominently on your confirmation page. This is often the thing they want most, and it’s the main reason they joined or filled out your form. So don’t hide it. Don’t make them click through a bunch of hoops to get it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to offer upsells or other options for things to do next, that’s fine, but make sure they get what they want without any hassle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"25-follow-up promptly\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">25. Follow up&nbsp;promptly</h2>\n\n\n<p>After the new lead has completed your form and gotten past your confirmation page, keep them engaged and continue to build on your new momentum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be sending out an automated welcome email that thanks them again and gives more information about whatever they just signed up for. You could also send a welcome series, which can introduce them more to your brand, point them to other products and services, give them a sense of your brand voice and personality, and make them feel part of a community if that’s relevant to your form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use SMS in a similar way, as long as you get explicit permission to use this channel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you got their mailing address, you could also ship them something, even as simple as a thank you card. Again, the more they feel wanted, respected, and valuable, and the more you deliver on what you promised, the happier they’ll be to continue receiving your marketing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>For higher&#8209;priced lead generation processes, you might consider a follow&#8209;up phone call to new leads. Email and SMS are great, but if you’re selling high&#8209;ticket items, the more personal you can get, the&nbsp;better.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"examples-of-great-lead-generation-forms-in action\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Examples of great lead generation forms in&nbsp;action</h2>\n\n<p>A few forms that employ the lead generation form best practices you’ve just read about are on display&nbsp;below.</p>\n\n\n<p>Use these lead generation form examples to inspire you to spruce up your forms and increase your conversion rates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1536\" height=\"936\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-10.png\" alt=\"example of lead gen forms from Empire Flippers\" class=\"wp-image-283973\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.responsify.com/multi-step-form-conversion-rate-optimization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Empire Flippers</a></h3>\n\n\n<p>This multistep form from Empire Flippers uses a progress bar and inline validation to increase completion rates and reduce errors. It also features some credibility statistics at the bottom of the form, serving as trust signals that this is a reputable company that delivers&nbsp;results.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"833\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-11.png\" alt=\"short, concise contact form example\" class=\"wp-image-283974\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.samvanderwielen.com/legal-workshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sam Vanderwielen</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form is short and simple, and uses all the copywriting best practices discussed earlier. It has a benefit-oriented value proposition and headline, offers a lead magnet in the form of an online course, and uses a personalized CTA button. The button copy could be better though — something like ‘Join the Course’ or ‘Show Me How’ would work better. It also uses descriptive labels and makes the phone number optional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p>It also avoids CAPTCHA, eliminating that potential conversion&nbsp;destroyer.</p>\n\n\n<img width=\"1600\" height=\"827\" src=\"https://akismet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-12.png\" alt=\"CTA for a free kitchen garden planning guide\" class=\"wp-image-283976\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://urbantaproots.com/product/gardencoachingpackage/\">Urban Taproots</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This form collects leads for a gardening coach, and offers a free 24-page kitchen garden planning guide. The form even lists four desirable elements of the guide, and includes a nice cover image. The headline uses action-oriented language. The CTA button isn’t benefit-oriented, but it is specific to what will happen when you click it. And the form is just about as short as you can get, asking only for a first name and email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"frequently-asked questions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently asked&nbsp;questions</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-common-mistakes-when-creating-a-lead-generation form\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are common mistakes when creating a lead generation&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Many websites include too many fields, and make too many of them required when they could be optional. Other mistakes include making the form too long when a multistep form could simplify it, using CAPTCHA, using ineffective dry language, burying the form, so most website visitors overlook it, and having ineffective or non-existent follow-up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"should-i-use-captcha-to-protect-my-form-from spam\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Should I use CAPTCHA to protect my form from&nbsp;spam?</h3>\n\n<p>No. CAPTCHA has been shown to negatively impact form conversion rates. CAPTCHA adds frustration to the form completion process and lowers conversions by&nbsp;3.2%.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-akismet-and-how-can-it-improve-my-lead-generation-form-conversion rate\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Akismet, and how can it improve my lead generation form conversion&nbsp;rate?</h3>\n\n<p>Akismet offers a frictionless approach to protecting your forms from being filled out by spammers and bots. It blocks IP addresses, email addresses, and names known to be associated with spammers using a continually&#8209;growing database and AI&nbsp;analysis.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-companies-generally-use akismet\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of companies generally use&nbsp;Akismet?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet is used by companies of all sizes, from small businesses to large multinational corporations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"what-is-the-ideal-number-of-fields-for-a-lead-generation form\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is the ideal number of fields for a lead generation&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>There is no ideal number of fields. It depends on the purpose of your form, the type and quality of leads you are attracting, your target audience, the price point of your products and services, and more. The general rule is to use as few fields as you need, and keep the non-essential ones optional.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-placement-of-a-lead-generation-form-affect-its performance\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does the placement of a lead generation form affect its&nbsp;performance?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Your form needs to be visible and impossible to overlook. It should not be placed too close to other items that will clutter up the experience and make it easy to miss. You can place it on the page in multiple locations such as at the top, on a sidebar, in the middle, or at the bottom. You can also feature multiple CTA buttons that all link to the same form.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"can-the-design-of-a-lead-generation-form-impact-user engagement\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can the design of a lead generation form impact user&nbsp;engagement?</h3>\n\n<p>Yes, forms that have poor color contrast, unclearly labeled form fields, poorly sized buttons, and too much clutter can make them harder to engage with. Plus, features like dropdown menus and two&#8209;column forms can make it harder to complete a form, especially on mobile&nbsp;devices.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-types-of-questions-should-be-avoided-in-a-lead-generation form\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What types of questions should be avoided in a lead generation&nbsp;form?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Avoid questions asking anything you don’t really need to know at this point in the lead generation process. Unless you need it to qualify leads at the very beginning of the process, leave those questions for later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 id=\"how-can-ab-testing-improve-the-effectiveness-of-lead-generation forms\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How can A/B testing improve the effectiveness of lead generation&nbsp;forms?</h3>\n\n<p>As long as your website gets enough traffic to conduct a statistically valid A/B test, this is the best way to determine which form features and details are most effective on your website, with your target market. Simply create two forms that are different in just one key detail, make it, so each one shows up during the testing phase, and see which one gets higher conversion rates. Then, take the winner, change another aspect of it, and run another test to continue improving the&nbsp;form.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-strategies-can-be-employed-to-reduce-form abandonment\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What strategies can be employed to reduce form&nbsp;abandonment?</h3>\n\n<p>You can reduce form abandonment by using multistep forms, inline validation, autofill, single&#8209;column layout, progress bars, benefit&#8209;oriented language and headlines, an inspiring offer, and fewer&nbsp;fields.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-does-the-copy-text-on-and-around-the-form-affect conversions\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does the copy (text) on and around the form affect&nbsp;conversions?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Good copy motivates leads to want whatever your lead generation form promises. All copy should point to the same place — fill out this form and get what you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Akismet: The #1 anti&#8209;spam solution for businesses and&nbsp;marketers</h3>\n\n\n<p>Akismet helps your lead generation forms perform as they should, without spammers and bots ruining the party. Our frictionless software prevents spammers from filling out your forms and making you wade through hundreds or thousands of fake signups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it does this without requiring the use of any silly CAPTCHA puzzles that just annoy everyone and make your leads feel like you don’t want them to fill out your forms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://akismet.com/pricing/\">Get Akismet</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Jen Swisher\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Do The Woo Community: Exploring Web Accessibility Success and Strategies with Christian Behrends\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=83958\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://dothewoo.io/exploring-web-accessibility-success-and-strategies-with-christian-behrends/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"Join Anne, Taeke, and Christian Behrends on the Do the Woo Accessibility podcast as they chat about web accessibility, share success stories, and provide valuable resources.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Jun 2024 09:12:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.6 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=17289\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/06/wordpress-6-6-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14081:\"<p>WordPress 6.6 Beta 1 is here!

Please follow the project&#8217;s responsible-disclosure practices detailed on this <a href=\"https://hackerone.com/wordpress\">HackerOne page</a> and in this <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/security/\">security white paper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s coming to WordPress 6.6?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s second major release is about polish and finesse. Features that landed in the last few releases have new flexibility and smoother flows—and a few new tricks. And of course there are a few brand-new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data Views updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the groundwork for phase 3, Data Views get new and improved experience of working with information in the Site Editor. A new layout consolidates patterns and template parts, gets you to general management views in fewer clicks, and packs in a wide range of refinements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overrides in synced patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What if you could keep a synced pattern‘s <em>look and feel</em> everywhere it appears—keeping it on brand—but have different <em>content</em> everywhere it appears?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, maybe you‘re building a pattern for recipes. Ideally, you want to keep the overall design of the recipe card consistent on every post that will have a recipe. But the recipe itself—the ingredients, the steps, special notes on technique—will be different every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And perhaps, in the future, other people might need to change the design of the recipe pattern. It would be nice to know they can do that, and that the content in existing recipes will stay right where it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In version 6.6, you can make all that happen, and overrides in synced patterns are the way you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">See all the blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Up to now, when you had a block selected and then opened the block Inserter, you only saw the blocks you were allowed to add to your selected block. Where were all the others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 6.6, when you have a block selected, you get two lists. First, there&#8217;s the list of blocks you can insert at your selected block. Then you get a list with all the other blocks. So you can get an idea of what you can use in your selected block, and what other blocks you could use in another area. In fact, if you select a block from that second list, WordPress 6.6 will add it below your block, to use in whatever you build next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A new publish flow</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.6 brings the post and site editors closer together than ever. So whether you’re writing for a post in the post editor or a page in the Site Editor, your experience will be about the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Style variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a block theme comes with style variations, 6.6 vastly expands your design options right out of the box, without installing or configuring a single thing. Because in 6.6, your theme  pulls the color palettes and typography style sets out of its installed variations to let you mix and match for a whole world of expanded creative expression.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Section styles </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you build themes? Now you can define style options for separate sections of multiple blocks, including inner blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then your users can apply those block style variations to entire groups of blocks, effectively creating branded sections they can curate across a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A note about CSS specificity</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it easier for your variations to override the global styles CSS, those styles now come wrapped in `:root`. That limits their specificity. <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/61810\">For details, read the full discussion on GitHub.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A native Grid layout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grid is a new variation for the Group block that lets you arrange the blocks inside it as a grid. If you&#8217;ve been using a plugin for this, now you can make your grids natively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better pattern management in Classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You heard right: You can do everything with patterns in Classic themes that you can in a block theme. You can see all the patterns available to you in a single view and insert a pattern on the fly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Negative. Margins.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re here: negative margin values, so you can make objects overlap in your design. As a guardrail, you can only set a negative margin by typing an actual negative number, not by using the slider. That’s to keep people from adding negative values they didn&#8217;t intend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rollback auto-updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can have the convenience of setting all your plugins to auto-update and the inner peace you get from knowing that if anything goes wrong, 6.6 will do a rollback. Automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>This post <strong><em>reflects the latest changes</em></strong> as of June 4, 2024.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Again, the features in this first beta

my life I like to experience things high/low, to stay grounded. So while I&#8217;ve been taken on culinary adventures with the best chefs in the world like <a href=\"https://noma.dk/\">René Redzepi</a> or <a href=\"https://www.singlethreadfarms.com/\">Kyle Connaughton</a>, sometimes I find myself on a United flight, as I am today, ordering the chicken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you move between two extremes it&#8217;s not the big things that bother you, for example I&#8217;m sure this <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/dining/in-pursuit-of-tastier-chickens-a-strict-diet-of-four-star-scraps.html\">chicken wasn&#8217;t raised on scraps from Michelin star restaurants</a>, as I was once told in New York, but the little things, like &#8220;Why is this butter as hard as a rock?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Butter, one of the most magical of ingredients, should spread. Yet it is served in so many places at a temperature that makes you feel more like you&#8217;re carving Play-doh. So I will now give you one of my favorite travel hacks: On United they nuke the main entree too hot to eat when it arrives, but this is now to your advantage because you can open the small butter tin and put it on the scorched entree and let thermodynamics turn it from rock-hard butter-ice to supple, delicious butter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process takes a minute or two, just enough time to eat your salad (be careful opening the pressurized balsamic dressing!) and allow the bread to cool a bit and be palatable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasion I have left the butter in the heat too long, and it liquifies, but then I just use it as a pour or dip my bread into it, imagining myself at <a href=\"https://peterluger.com/\">Peter Luger&#8217;s</a> dipping my steak into the collected deliciousness at the bottom of the dish. If you&#8217;re serving at home, softening the butter and warming plates is an easy way to elevate your game.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Jun 2024 00:57:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Gravatar: Introducing Profiles-as-a-Service and our new REST API\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.gravatar.com/?p=1415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://blog.gravatar.com/2024/06/03/profiles-as-a-service/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4475:\"<p>For two decades, Gravatar has been an unsung hero of the internet, quietly powering billions of avatars across websites like Slack, OpenAI, Atlassian, and more. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Gravatar suite of tools: our new REST API.

Users can share as little or as much as they want and have multiple profiles using different email addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The API allows businesses and developers to access and manage user profile data, simplifying development and enabling more personalized interactions and engaging user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Getting Started is Simple</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar is free for both end users and developers.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast, which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, making it significantly easier to create WordPress websites with Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Adam Zielinski. Adam is the creator of WordPress Playground, a WordPress core committer, and tech editor release lead for WordPress 6.0. He works as a WordPress developer at Automattic. In his spare time, he can be found bouldering, practicing improv comedy, and playing badminton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Playground, a groundbreaking project that is redefining the way we interacted with WordPress. Adam&#8217;s visionary approach to creating a seamless WordPress experience with a web browser has revolutionized how easy it is to access WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed Playground&#8217;s history, from the initial frustrations that sparked the idea, to the development process that brought it to life. We gain an understanding of the profound impact Playground is having on the WordPress landscape, and its potential to shape the future of web development. It&#8217;s not often that the word profound is rightly used, but it feels appropriate here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the enormous potential uses of Playground, from simplifying setup processes to enabling experimentation with plugins and themes. Adam&#8217;s vision for Playground as a catalyst for democratizing website creation, and enabling a culture of innovation within the WordPress community, is something that&#8217;s still evolving, and it&#8217;s clear that the direction that the project takes is still being figured out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project really does change the way that WordPress can be used, and there&#8217;s so many exciting prospects for how it might shape the future of web design and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in hearing about cutting edge advancements reshaping the WordPress landscape, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to find out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptaverm.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Adam Zielinski.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Adam Zelinski. Hello Adam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Hello Nathan. Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> He&#8217;s giving me the thumbs up. You can&#8217;t see it, but I had to practice Adam&#8217;s surname several times. And I&#8217;m going to just say it that once, because there&#8217;s a high chance I got it wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:31] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> It was perfect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. We&#8217;re going to talk today a little bit about a very, very exciting development in the WordPress space. You probably have caught sight of it, if you follow the WordPress project closely. It&#8217;s called Playground, and it is profoundly interesting. And if you&#8217;ve not touched it, it may be that some of the things that we&#8217;re going to talk about today will, I&#8217;m going to say, it will shock you. Because what Adam has thrown together is something truly remarkable, to help you create WordPress websites on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get into that a little bit later. Before we do that, Adam, would you just spend a moment just telling us a little bit about yourself. Your WordPress journey, where you work, where you live, whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:09] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Absolutely. So I live in Poland. I work at Automattic, I&#8217;m sponsored to work on the open source WordPress project full time. I&#8217;ve been doing software for like 20 years now. I started back in secondary school. I found this little website on the internet where you could get little geeks, just to make a website for a furniture store. Nothing, like an e-commerce store. I just, hey, we exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And no one there asked if I&#8217;m 13 or not, so I was able to get going like this. And also my brother, he was doing video games at the time. So I also had someone to coach me. Yeah, these days I spent my entire professional time building WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also do some bouldering. I do improv comedy. In fact, like in a couple of weeks, I go to some workshops. And then In July, there&#8217;s one musical workshop on a festival, and after that we&#8217;ll have a short performance on the main stage. So that will be my first time on a big event like that in the improv scene. So I&#8217;m as excited as nervous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Absolutely fascinating. May I ask, do you do your comedy in your native language, or do you stray into other languages as well? Because I imagine the barrier to being funny in a different language is quite considerable, because of all the nuances and the little phrases that people use, and the quirks of the lilt, and the rise, and the fall, and all of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:28] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yeah, I do it in Polish and in English. But in improv comedy, you don&#8217;t have to be as concerned about the little phrases, because if you play a character truthfully, and your partner on the scene plays a character that has interesting interactions with you, like with your character, the comedy is in the scene, right? Like you don&#8217;t have to try to be funny. In fact, if you try being funny, you probably won&#8217;t be. So it&#8217;s about being real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so you&#8217;re in character during these? Wow, honestly, I feel there&#8217;s a whole other podcast that we could have done right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:58] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re going to drag it, kicking and screaming, back to WordPress. Thank you for your bio though. That is amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you are working for Automattic, and you are a full-time contributor to WordPress. Now, did you say WordPress Core? But then I also think I heard you say that you are working on Playground full-time, at the same time. So are you on Core, Playground, or both?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:19] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> I think I&#8217;m more like, way more on Playground side of things these days. So I started with the Gutenberg project, then I became a Core committer there. I was also contributing to WordPress Core. And now I am spending like virtually my entire time on Playground side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this involves interacting with WordPress Core and WordPress Core teams. So these days we use Playground, for example, during the plugin review process, theme review process. There is a Gutenberg block that allows you to embed Playground in a post or WordPress page. I think it&#8217;s been recently deployed to learn.wordpress.org. Now I&#8217;m interacting with that team to get some interactive courses and learning materials online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t committed anything to Core in a, yeah, in a couple of months. But you have to choose where to allocate your time. It&#8217;s very difficult to split your attention between multiple projects, like we just discussed that off the record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Before we hit record, we had a conversation about shattered attention and things like that. Can I ask, when you created Playground, and obviously, dear listener, apologies, you may not know yet what it is, but we&#8217;ll just get this bit out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you created Playground, was that a project that you were working on as a side project? Were you just doing that in your spare time, or was this something that Automattic, for example, wished to bring into existence, and so you got the job of doing that? So yeah, how did it actually begin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:41] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> I don&#8217;t think anyone dreamt it was even possible at the time. I was just writing a technical tutorial for something in WordPress. And I wrote the lessons, and then I realised that before publishing it, I also have to write lesson number one, setup. And there it opened a Pandora box of, oh, install Docker. Oh, maybe you&#8217;re on Windows, maybe you need WSL. Oh, install, Node.js. What&#8217;s Git, right? Like, here some resources about Git.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I get so annoyed with that. I wanted to write none of it. I wanted a set up checklist that just says, click this button. And so I wondered, well, you could do this with a cloud setup, an infrastructure, right? Like, sort of like GitHub code spaces, where you spin up something in, I don&#8217;t know, like Amazon Cloud or Google Cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that costs money. That&#8217;s difficult to maintain. It&#8217;s also not that easy to set up, right? It takes time. And then you have all sorts of problems like, what if someone uploads illegal content in there? Are you hosting that now? And so I thought, well, we should be really running WordPress in the browser. Only that&#8217;s impossible, right? But I wonder, maybe it&#8217;s not impossible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I knew about this technology, WebAssembly. It was the promise of running all the regular desktop software in web browsers. I&#8217;ve been hearing about it for like 10 or 15 years, at that time maybe. So I felt like, I wonder if that went anywhere. And so I started digging and tinkering. And two weeks later, I had a very rough prototype.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of things didn&#8217;t work. You sometimes got kicked out of WP Admin. You know, like styles wouldn&#8217;t load all that. It was super slow, but it worked. And my manager at the time, I think he was like preoccupied with other stuff, so he didn&#8217;t mind. When I came up with this prototype, I got very mixed reactions actually. Like some people were super amazed and like, whoa, there&#8217;s so many implications to this, and, wow, it&#8217;s magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But actually, most people were like, yeah, it&#8217;s a cool toy. What are we going to do with it? It has no practical uses. And it took months to get the perception of Playground further, to get people to perceive Playground as something actually revolutionary, because it absolutely is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And something that takes WordPress into so many new possible applications. It solves the most annoying problems WordPress. Setup, resetting your site, right? Like, when you want to try new plugins, everyone&#8217;s always creating new sites, and then deleting them, or resetting the same site to its original state, or previewing code changes on GitHub, I can keep going like that. But yeah, I think, did I answer your question?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, yeah. that&#8217;s great. So I&#8217;ll just paraphrase what my experience of Playground is, because we haven&#8217;t laid that foundation out. I don&#8217;t understand the underlying technology, so Adam is going to have to shepherd me through that, as we have this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from the end user&#8217;s perspective, when I&#8217;ve set up WordPress websites in the past, there&#8217;s always been some kind of interaction with a file structure. You have to download WordPress from .org in my case. And you take it from there, and you upload that, and then you create a database, and you bind the database to the wordpress.org repo that you&#8217;ve created, and then you&#8217;re off to the races. And you have to host that somewhere, and that whole process now can be done with the click of a button inside of a lot of hosting companies and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s some kind of wall there. You either have to interact with files, or you have to pay a hosting company to make that happen. And the first time I saw a Playground, I clicked a button, and there was a WordPress website, a moment or two later. And I genuinely do mean a moment or two later, I think the time it&#8217;s taking me to say this sentence is significantly longer than the time that it takes to get your website up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I remember I had no context around what it was. Nobody told me what was going to happen. They just said, oh, click this. So I clicked that. And I was staring at the screen thinking, what, there&#8217;s WordPress, but I didn&#8217;t have to pay for anything, I didn&#8217;t have to go anywhere, it just appeared. And then the cogs start going in my head. Where&#8217;s the database? Where&#8217;s the files? Where&#8217;s all this come from? How is this possible?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then being truly flawed by it, thinking, no, this is some kind of implementation of, as you said, WebAssembly. This is happening inside the browser. And then of course, the admiration comes in like, how did that get done? Who did that? And of course it was you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is the ability to install WordPress, inside the browser, at the click of a button. A fully functional WordPress site. So there&#8217;s no impediment to using it, apart from if you don&#8217;t have three seconds to wait, give up. That&#8217;s the only problem. If you don&#8217;t have three seconds to spare, then okay, fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so the technical bit I want to dig into a lot, it&#8217;s a podcast, so we won&#8217;t go right into the weeds. But, when I click that button, and I want Playground to be invoked, to have my WordPress website, broadly what&#8217;s going on? Like, there must be files somewhere. There has to be the file structure of WordPress. There has to be a database in some way, shape, or form, because that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s built? Where are they coming from? And once they&#8217;ve come from there, where are they now living?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:49] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> They all live in your browser. Playground, very broadly, is a technology to run the entire WordPress tech stack in your browser. So to run it on a server, you typically need something like, people call it LAMP stack, right? Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. And Playground brings all these pieces into the browser, in some shape, or form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So PHP, for example, we are running as WebAssembly. So PHP, the programming language, is a program in itself, right? Like, it&#8217;s written in C, you can look it up on GitHub, and you can build it as something you can run on a server. But now with WebAssembly, you can also build it as something you can run in JavaScript, which means the web browsers can run it, and Node.js can run it, and a lot of other environments can run it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the database, MySQL. We don&#8217;t run MySQL in the browser. Technically, maybe we could do that, but there&#8217;s a lot of reasons not to. Instead, we are running SQLite, and SQLite doesn&#8217;t require a separate program. It&#8217;s just a library, and it writes all your data to a file. So when you run Playground, it actually downloads a pre-populated database with WordPress already installed, so you don&#8217;t have to go through the installation wizard. All the queries, all the SQL queries go through that database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the syntax is a little bit different than with MySQL, and we have an entire translation layer to take MySQL queries, and express them in SQLite, and take SQLite results, and express them as something that came from MySQL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So really the same W DB object works for interacting with the database. Then we have Apache. Normally you run a web server, and this allows you to request different pages. Now, WordPress works as a, you navigate it as a classic website, right? So we click a link, and then the URL changes in your browser bar. Which means the browser had to perform a request, ask some server somewhere, get a response, and then maybe there are images, and scripts, and styles in that response. So it has to go and fetch all these resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And normally you have an Apache, or Nginx, or another server software running somewhere, and the browser goes there. Obviously we don&#8217;t have that in the browser, but there&#8217;s a cool technology web browser supports these days. It&#8217;s called Service Workers. And you can intercept all HTTP requests. And it&#8217;s meant for progressive web apps, so we can run offline. But we are playing a little trick on that Service Worker. And instead of caching things, we are just rerouting that to PHP, where WordPress can serve them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, in the LAMP stack you have Linux, which provides you with all the external world, right? So it allows you to allocate memory, write files, read files, interact with the network. It gives you access to all the devices on your computer. Again, like, we don&#8217;t have access to all of that in the browser, but we are shipping implementation of all these bits written in JavaScript. So we have a JavaScript file system, it&#8217;s just three objects in trench coat, right? Like, pretending to be a directory structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a networking bridge that can rewrite network traffic as fetch calls. We have memory allocator, which is the compiler that turns PHP source code into WebAssembly. And so on and so forth. So it&#8217;s the entire tech stack running in the browser. And you can also ship it to so many other devices. We have a CLI tool. We have a VS Code extension. So we just installed it from the marketplace, and boom, we have a WordPress server. No dependencies at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ella Van Durpe, I hope I&#8217;m pronouncing that right, she built an app called Blocknotes. It&#8217;s Playground, it&#8217;s WordPress, in an iOS app, in App store. I bet you would be able to run it on your smart fridge, right? If you had enough time. So really this turns WordPress into an application engine, so to speak. You could write a WordPress plugin, bundle it as Playground, and ship it to all these places where Playground can run, which means most devices these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I just want to make sure that the listeners have really grasped what&#8217;s going on here. So this is WordPress purely inside the browser. Through all of the contrivances and clever things that Adam has just described, it&#8217;s all happening inside the browser. And so just dwell on that for a moment, because that is actually pretty profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do wonder, when you&#8217;d been working on it for a couple of weeks, and you actually had this version working, you said it had various faults, which I guess you&#8217;ve been tackling as time has gone on. Did you get that sense of, wait, what have I done here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, this is quite remarkable, because the stated mission of WordPress is democratise publishing. Let&#8217;s just concentrate on the word democratise there. It&#8217;s get anything into the hands of everybody. That&#8217;s really what the endeavor of the project is, get publishing into the hands of everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a big impediment to that is the experimentation part, playing with WordPress, being able to judge whether it&#8217;s a good fit for you, your business, the agency that you run, whatever. And especially for non-technical people, trying WordPress out is a bit of a faff. You could either do it on the desktop, with downloading additional software, but again, if you&#8217;re not very technical, that is a bit of a hurdle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a one button install, three second wait, whatever it may be. And then you&#8217;re off to the races. So, again, now that I&#8217;ve said all of that, did you get a sense of the profundity, the profound nature of what you&#8217;d built, after you&#8217;d worked for those two weeks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:12] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yes. I was staring at the screen, I distinctly remember thinking, this is profound. I didn&#8217;t fully understand all the implications with all the devices. WordPress as a vector for delivering apps. Maybe setting up a site, not even knowing how to code, and then pressing a button, and exporting that as something you can run on a desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by the way, we are not there today. Technology allows that we don&#8217;t have that button. But I knew this is going to change the way we think about WordPress, and the way we use it, the way we learn WordPress. But I guess I was mostly focused on things that annoyed me specifically. So maybe that tutorial, right? Oh, now I will be able to teach people without asking them to go through all these steps. Or maybe now I will be able to try out plugins, or do development environments, again, like without spending all that time. And maybe that can work on Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But honestly, I feel like we&#8217;re only still scratching the surface. And I understand more and more about Playground every month, like the apps angle I just told you about. That came up I think in April, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s another idea, if you can run an app on your mobile phone. And we were also exploring synchronising data between Playgrounds and WordPresses. So maybe you would write an article in a Playground, and it&#8217;ll get published in a website somewhere. And then maybe that website could have five different copies, and they would all synchronise in real time. And I think we&#8217;re like quarters, or years away from that. But assuming we had that, maybe WordPress could power a social network app, right? Since you can run it on every device, and you can exchange data in a distributed way. There&#8217;s all sorts of wild ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so we&#8217;re back at the beginning, you&#8217;ve spent a couple of weeks building it, and you&#8217;ve got this working, functional prototype, let&#8217;s call it like that. It feels like that got picked up fairly rapidly, because then I started hearing about it, Playground, at various different points. I remember attending one of the WordPress flagship events, I can&#8217;t remember which one it was. Matt Mullenweg was on the stage, and he was just basically saying, oh, and there&#8217;s this, you know, everybody should check this out. This is pretty amazing. And I was thinking, gosh, okay, this is now a serious endeavor if it&#8217;s getting mentioned at that kind of event, that&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you then were able to start working on it, more or less full time. And I&#8217;m guessing that there must have been some conversation to be had there, within Automattic. People must have realised, yeah, let&#8217;s get Adam on this. We can see some blue sky in this project. We can see some useful things that we could do with it. Is that kind of what happened, that your work week got turned around and, okay, Adam, you are on Playground now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:47] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yeah, you got it more or less right. I&#8217;m saying more or less because, so Automattic is sort of choose your own journey type of place, where you can be in a team where you&#8217;re very directed, or you can be in a team where you&#8217;re very autonomous, right? There&#8217;s all sorts of teams out there. And I was always a free electron type of person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just started working on Playground. I like saying no one stopped me, that&#8217;s more of what happened. And these days, team for Playground. So there&#8217;s three of us, and it&#8217;s a very nice change. So there&#8217;s Brandon, there&#8217;s Bero, and there&#8217;s me. And, man, it&#8217;s so nice just working on this with other people, because it&#8217;s been quite a lonely journey for some time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had support from Dennis Snell, who&#8217;s been also maintaining Playground while I was on a sabbatical. I appreciate Dennis so much, and he&#8217;s done so much good for Playground. We don&#8217;t have enough time to discuss it. At the same time, he&#8217;s also had a lot of other projects on his plate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was mostly trying to figure out, oh, let&#8217;s communicate about Playground. Let&#8217;s publish something. Let&#8217;s prepare a video for a State of the Word. But let&#8217;s also keep developing new features. Let&#8217;s also focus on the vision, and let&#8217;s also fix any bug people report, right? Like, I was all over the place. And these days, I feel Playground is in a much better place, in terms of focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things we want to do in a short term is figure out all the ways Playground can crash. We&#8217;ve seen a uptick in usage of Playground. It&#8217;s been featured on a few workshops, on learn.wordpress.org. I think Ryan Welcher featured it. Jonathan Bossenger, I think Anne McCarthy also did, and a few other people. This really inspired some folks to start using it, building blueprints for the plugin directory, to share a live demo of their plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, when you see more users, they discover more issues in the software. So that&#8217;s what happened, and that&#8217;s fantastic because now we can fix all of that. But this also means new feature development isn&#8217;t going forward as quickly, as if Playground was already stable. But stability, building trust, releasing a high quality documentation, that&#8217;s a big priority right now. Because if the platform isn&#8217;t stable, it won&#8217;t be as useful. So that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re trying to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I remember using it, as I said, for the first time, and pressing the button, getting my WordPress website, and there it was, everything working as you would expect, the brand new, up-to-date version of WordPress. And then closing the browser, and wondering, okay, what&#8217;s going to happen now? And at that point, that was that. Everything that I just created, was gone. So, well, that&#8217;s fine. I had no expectations beyond there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering if, in the future, the disposable nature of it might be something that you are working on, so that it could persist. Let&#8217;s say that I click the button, get the WordPress Playground going, but then choose to come back to it, I don&#8217;t know, a week later, two weeks later, it&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m doing as a side project. The way that I&#8217;ve interacted with it, that would&#8217;ve been impossible. Everything is disposed of the moment you close the browser window. But just wondering if persistence was something that might even be possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Absolutely. And there&#8217;s a bunch of ways to tackle that. So right now in Playground, in the upper right corner, there&#8217;s a little button, it says like WordPress 6.5, PHP 8.3. And it allows you to change versions of WordPress current PHP, but it also allows you to change the way Playground is persisted. So the default mode is that it&#8217;s temporary, and it&#8217;s gone the moment you close your browser tab. But there&#8217;s also a browser cache mode, so then when you return to Playground website, it&#8217;ll remember your last site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s also an experimental mode, that allows you to synchronise Playground to your local directory on your computer, from your web browser. So if you choose that, the entire WordPress structure will be recreated on your machine. And if you make changes in Visual Studio Code, for example, they will show up in Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also an export button, so you can download your site as a zip file. You can export it to GitHub as a pull request. That feature also exists. With pull request specifically, I&#8217;m exploring a static site collaboration workflow. So the idea is this, you have a GitHub repository, you have a lot of content in there. Maybe that&#8217;s a documentation for something, maybe that&#8217;s entire website. So you have HTML pages, you have uploads, you have some plugins. And that repo is used to create a static site, and it&#8217;s hosted somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you can also go to that static site, and let&#8217;s imagine it&#8217;s a documentation site. So maybe every article has a little button called Edit in Playground, and you click it, and it opens Playground with that article already loaded in the editor. You change it, you upload something, you click export to GitHub as a pull request, and boom, there it goes, there is a change proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, someone else would be able to review it by clicking a button in that pull request, and loading your changes in Playground, and say, hey, good job, or, oh, there&#8217;s a typo, let me fix it. And they will just update that pull request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is truly fascinating. And it is just really blowing apart the very nature of what it is. Because when you first came up with it, I feel like the word Playground was just the perfect encapsulation for what it is. You know, you just mess around, and then you close it down, start something else, mess around, close it down. You&#8217;re just messing about. You just want to test out a new plugin, you want to try something new, you just want to see what the latest default WordPress theme looks like, and how you do full site editing, and all of that. You just want to have a tinker, and you just want to do it. You&#8217;ve got a little bit of time, and then you close the browser and it goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it seems like the intuition here is that, you&#8217;re stepping away from Playground&#8217;s roots, if you like, of just, it&#8217;s disposable, it&#8217;s just for a bit of fun. And it&#8217;s moving into the territory of something more permanent. So not just, it can be retained and persists in the browser, but we&#8217;ve got ways of shipping this. We can take this from your Playground, we can put it up to GitHub, and then from GitHub, who knows where that could end up. You know, it could end up in a CDN somewhere as a static website, like you said, or it could do a multitude of other things. It sounds like it&#8217;s going from more Playground, to developing actual real world projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:04] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yes. So that static site, for example, it could be completely static. So you could run it without any PHP hosting, so very cheaply on a CDN. But then you could go to slash WP Admin, and you could have a running Playground there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So it&#8217;s static without the static.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:21] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yes. Perhaps block markup could replace markdown for a lot of use cases actually. Because in markdown, it&#8217;s great for simple documents, but then if you want to go beyond that, people started inventing ways of extending that. So maybe you have MDX that brings React to markdown. Maybe you have syntax extensions. I think Gutenberg repo uses some of that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of these projects, and all these things amount to blocks essentially. Just give me more ways, more widgets in markdown, give me more things I can express, right? And with Playground, yeah, like you can express any WordPress block. Just install it in WordPress, export, use it in a post, save that content of that post, that&#8217;s your block markup. And there&#8217;s a lot of ways you can interact with it. Render it, right? You can edit it in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to your point, there is a development environment these days. It&#8217;s been released by wordpress.com, it&#8217;s called Studio. And it&#8217;s actually built on top of Playground, right? So we don&#8217;t need any Docker. You don&#8217;t need any virtual machines. It&#8217;s running Playground inside an Electron app, and it just works. You don&#8217;t need any dependencies. Just install it, there it goes. Maybe that same environment, with the Playground for its WordPress for Apps paradigm, right? Maybe we&#8217;ll see it on tablet at one point. With all the ways to utilise Playground, actually, I have a note, let me refresh my memory a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so if you&#8217;ve ever been to a contributor day, you&#8217;ve probably seen how difficult the setup can be, right? Just getting WordPress running on your machine for a new person, it can easily take the entire contributor day, even if you have full access to WordPress Core developers during the event. Playground can reduce that to a single step. And there can be even multiple, predefined WordPress builds, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a Gutenberg developer? Are you a Core developer? Do you want to just contribute to docs? Then we could take it to a browser, right? So you wouldn&#8217;t even have to do anything locally, and you could still take advantage of Git, and pull requests, and all these workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further along, perhaps we could encapsulate some contribution workflows without ever reasoning about code, right? So I imagined a theme directory on wordpress.org. It could have Playground, where you would just build a theme, you would be able to go back to it, submit it for a review, right? If we add a code editor to that, now we can have a plugin contribution workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, we&#8217;re about to launch a community space for Playground Blueprints. So Blueprints are these configuration files that express an entire WordPress setup. So maybe you want a WordPress with WPCLI and a specific plugins, or maybe you want a WordPress with a so and so theme, and a bunch of content, right? Maybe that&#8217;s your site. Or maybe you want to preinstall your plugin, and configure it with a useful default content for the demo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can now encode that as a JSON file, and the blueprints community space, it&#8217;ll be just that. It&#8217;ll be what wordpress.org/plugin is, but for these blueprints. So everyone will be able to share a blueprint, review the blueprints that are already there, immediately launch a WordPress site from any of these blueprints. And I hope this will spark a lot of cool ideas for Playground usage. Honestly, people are teaching me so much about what you can do with Playground these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone recently mentioned this idea, they really don&#8217;t like working with PowerPoint, and there are ways of building slides in WordPress. So now I have a blueprint that turns WordPress into a slide building, presentation building program. It&#8217;s configured with the right theme, it has some slides already in it, it has an export to PDF button, and you can just start editing and then save a presentation, export it as a PDF, host it as a static site, right? If you want to share a link with the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m not even like touching on things like classroom usage, or education use cases, right? There&#8217;s a professor using Playground to teach students about building websites, and it&#8217;s very easy for them because it doesn&#8217;t require installing anything. So I think like the university computers are like locked down so you cannot install custom software, but you can open websites. So you can go to a Playground site, or this version of Playground site where you have a code editor. And you can just start hacking with a plugin, or just a setup. And then you can export it, or submit it for grading, publish what the entire class created. There&#8217;s a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I mean, truly, the sky is the limit really, isn&#8217;t it? Because, again, just to take you back to that moment where you had spent two weeks on it, and there it was in its nascent form, none of this was going through your head. And now here we are a little while later, and it&#8217;s almost like, you know, you&#8217;ve got the theme repository, you&#8217;ve got the plugin repository, and I feel like we need a Playground repository. And, you know, you&#8217;ve described it as blueprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That just seems to have so much utility. Just different flavors of WordPress. Okay, do you want a super stripped down version of WordPress? Are you just beginning? Do you just want to look at WordPress for the first time? Click this button. Are you more experienced? Do you want to get straight into the full site editing? Okay, click this button, and you&#8217;ll be hit with that as soon as you launch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then of course, all of the different things, the companies who produce plugins, who would like to be able to demonstrate what their plugin does, well that, until now, required you click a button, and you connect it to some third party service that they pay for, which spins up a WordPress website with their configuration. Now, you just click a button and it&#8217;s there in the browser, and it can now come with the dependencies that it needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a WooCommerce plugin house, and obviously you need WooCommerce built into it. You can have that set as a dependency. So click the button, not only does our plugin come, but it&#8217;s fully configured, ready to go with WooCommerce and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just so many uses. And then it feels to me, this is kind of like not really stretching the horizon very far, but it feels to me that, then the ability to be able to click a button inside of your Playground, and then take it to more traditional hosting, so that you do have something more permanent. Might be kind of useful, but from everything that you&#8217;ve said, there&#8217;s a thousand different directions, tendrils going all over the place, you know, the education space. Just a million different things. And I guess that must be one of the nice things from where you are sitting. You&#8217;re just seeing all of this interaction in a project that you built, and that must be joyous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:49] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> It is. And, man, like there&#8217;s so many great ideas floating around in the community. Use cases I would never come up with in a million years. And I just love seeing more and more of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do like the idea of being able to go to an official blueprint repository, if you like, and just sift through user submitted versions of WordPress. Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve just decided that you want to start selling a course online, here&#8217;s a perfectly pre-configured LMS experience for you, just so that you can see how that works. And, you know, or a shop, a WooCommerce shop, or just a regular WordPress website with full site editing, all done for you. But now we&#8217;re going to use this theme, oh, you are not happy with that one, try this Playground over here, we&#8217;ve got a different theme, but everything else is just the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1,001 user submitted, varients of WordPress, and that&#8217;s never been possible. We&#8217;re always starting from, basic WordPress then build things on top of it, because of the fact that there&#8217;s a lot of work which needs to go in before your site is working. Now with all these dependencies built in, the click of a button, there it is, ready to go. Like you said, it&#8217;s profound. It really is incredibly profound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:01] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> One more cool thing I wanted to share though, we have a plugin for WordPress. You install it, and then you go to WP Admin plugins directory, and every plugin has install now button, it has it now, but it also has preview now button. And that preview now button clones your website in Playground, installs that plugin, and opens it in a new tab, so you can see, oh, do I like using it? Would it break my website? Is it even doing what I need it do? And you don&#8217;t like it, you just close that tab, and your production site is as it was before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d forgotten about that. Yeah. But if you go to wordpress.org, now there&#8217;s a button. I remember there was a little bit of a kerfuffle where, it was a few months ago, where Playground got launched on the plugin repository, and for various different reasons, dependencies largely being the thing I think, that got withdrawn. Then, I think now it is that the plugin developers need to just tick a box to say, yes please on my plugin listing, please put Playground there because that will be something that I want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I would imagine the majority, so long as it works, why wouldn&#8217;t you have that? You can go and experiment. So that&#8217;s new. If you haven&#8217;t been to the wordpress.org plugin repository recently, there is now, on a lot of plugins, a button just to use Playground. Click the button, you&#8217;ll see it, you&#8217;ll be able to see it immediately, and all the wonderful things that it does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:16] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yeah, although that&#8217;s not what I meant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Ah, apologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:19] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> What I meant is, there&#8217;s a separate plugin called the Playground. And if you install it on your WordPress site, you will get that preview button inside WP Admin, and it&#8217;ll preview that plugin a copy of your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Wheels within wheels. It&#8217;s very meta that isn&#8217;t it? I didn&#8217;t know that existed. So you&#8217;ve got a Playground site. Inside of that Playground site, you can install the Playground plugin. I guess you could get inception going on there, couldn&#8217;t you? Playground within Playground. within Playground, all the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:49] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Yeah, that is actually possible. So there&#8217;s a Playground Gutenberg block, and it&#8217;s in the WordPress plugin directory, and it has a preview button and it opens a Playground with that block inside Playground. So yeah, there are multiple levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve obviously waxed lyrical. I think it&#8217;s a fabulous project. Just what it&#8217;s going to open up in the future, who knows. I think the word profound, I think that&#8217;s the exact appropriate word at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, all of this light that we&#8217;re shining on it, I presume there&#8217;s still things that you would like to fix. Things that don&#8217;t yet work as expected, that maybe some things which you&#8217;ll never be able to overcome, given the state of what browsers can do at the moment. Should we just talk about that? What are some of the limitations that you know of at the moment?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:28] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Absolutely. So not all PHP extensions are supported in the browser, and we support more every month. But not yet at the place where you would have 100%. It&#8217;ll never be 100% right? Like for example, you cannot use Curl in a web browser. You can use it in a node version of Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just bringing in support for different image formats. So WebP and surprisingly jpeg. Png was already in there. Network is a large challenge. So WordPress would sometimes open, let me speak with a little bit more jargon. WordPress would sometimes open a TCP sockets to specific addresses, and you don&#8217;t have that API in the browser, right. You can only do fetch and few more things, but not that. So that may never be supported. Like if browsers had that, it would be large security risk. You can however do that in a node version of Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The database support. I think all core features work well. And we even had a 99% of unit tests passing in Playground. But there are some plugins using MySQL features that are not yet supported. So I think one of them is select union. So we still have some work to do with the database support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by default Playground doesn&#8217;t have access to network, and you have to enable it in Playground options. That&#8217;s a performance thing. Playground is significantly slower with that. So just to give everyone snappy experience by default. However, we do have something going on to have networking by default and also have it being very performant. That will hopefully go away sometime soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, like we&#8217;re learning about new limitations. Yeah, I would say like every week of every month, people come to Playground repository, they ask about their use case and someone wanted to use soap client. It&#8217;s not supported at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone else wanted to run a real server, right? So send a link to someone, somewhere and it&#8217;s just running in your browser. So we cannot really do that at the moment. But maybe it will be possible actually in the future. Like, I&#8217;m playing with a few ideas about that. So if you use Playground and something isn&#8217;t working right, come say hi to the Meta Playground channel on WordPress org Slack, or the WordPress slash WordPress dash Playground repository on GitHub, and tell us, we may not know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel like you&#8217;ve created a bit of an iPhone moment with WordPress. What I mean by that was, everybody had a mobile phone prior to the iPhone, and then the iPhone came along, and then everybody really wanted an iPhone because it was so profoundly different. And it feels like you&#8217;ve done something profoundly different with WordPress, and when apps came along and suddenly, yeah, there was an iPhone, but it was an iPhone and it looked nice and everything, and then apps came along and made the iPhone more profoundly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve enabled more profoundly interesting things to be done with WordPress than could be done two years ago, and the supplying of that is crucial. But it&#8217;ll be interesting if we have this conversation in, let&#8217;s say three years time, I think the real interest will be, not necessarily the Playground bit, and forgive me, I&#8217;m not denigrating what you&#8217;ve done because it&#8217;s remarkable, but it&#8217;s what everybody will do with the Playground that you&#8217;ve built. And the unique things that they&#8217;ve created. And the hither to as yet unimagined things, which will become commonplace and normal with WordPress, that at the moment nobody&#8217;s even conceived. And you&#8217;ve hinted at a few of those now. And so you&#8217;ve genuinely stirred interest, and something novel in the WordPress space and that isn&#8217;t often happening..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:16] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Thank you so much. I&#8217;m blushing. Yeah. truly amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And think that iPhone moment analogy, it&#8217;s excellent. And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll borrow that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When the App Store came to the iPhone, that moment where the iPhone, which was fun and you could play songs with it, but you couldn&#8217;t do all the other things, like store your notes and sync them to the cloud and communicate with other people on chat apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine the developer community will jump on board and come up with a thousand different ways to build on top of Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:46] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> The analogy may be going further than it seems at first because every blueprint is like an app, right? You have WordPress as your vehicle for setting things up. And then you can create a slide building app, as I said earlier. But I had someone running Doom, like the video game in the Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you can build a course website with it, right? If you just pre-configure it in the correct way. We have a pull request previewer running in a couple of projects, right? You have a preview link on GitHub just posted automatically. You have plugin previewers. You have project demos. So many different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a blueprint that if you run it, it doesn&#8217;t actually create a Playground you can use, but it gives you a zip file. And in that zip there is a static version of what you started with, right? So now you can not only produce different WordPress setups and website setups, but also artifacts, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe another blueprint could, I don&#8217;t know, render a PDF, right? And that would be another version of your slides, to keep using this example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can embed Playground. You can ship Playground on all the devices. So I&#8217;m imagining a world where you can build a WordPress plugin, click a button, and now you have a desktop app. You have a server app. You have a front end app. You have a progressive web app. You have a phone app. You have a tablet app. You have a terminal app, right from a single code base. We don&#8217;t have that button today, but I think it&#8217;s very possible to build one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It feels like the slogan is Playground, taking the friction out of using WordPress. Making that first step so much easier. No matter what your level of experience, if it&#8217;s the first time you&#8217;ve used WordPress, or if you want to do something more complicated. Just that frictionless step that you&#8217;ve created is, yeah, absolutely brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just before we go, I know that you mentioned the Slack channel where you are hanging out. Maybe you want to mention that again, just so it&#8217;s gone into people&#8217;s heads. But also if anybody is curious, maybe there&#8217;s other places where you can help with the Playground project, but also if you&#8217;re willing, are places where people can get in touch with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:52] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> Absolutely. Twitter is one of them. I&#8217;m most attentive to GitHub, cause I&#8217;m spending a lot of time in the Playground repo and all the Playground related activity. So probably the easiest way to reach me is through issues and discussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have something unrelated to the product, but just wanted to explore your use case, ping me on Twitter. There&#8217;s WordPress.org Slack, called meta-playground and that&#8217;s another good place. And also I&#8217;ll be on WordCamp EU in June. I&#8217;ll be having a talk on the main stage about WordPress Playground. So come, say hi. Watch the talk and let&#8217;s talk in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice. Thank you very much. Adam Zelensky, thank you so much for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:34] <strong>Adam Zielinski:</strong> It&#8217;s been so lovely, naan. Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/adamzielin\">Adam Zielinski</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam is the creator of WordPress Playground, a WordPress core committer, and Tech Editor release lead for WordPress 6.0. He works as a WordPress developer at Automattic and lives in Wrocław, Poland. In his spare time, he can be found bouldering, practising improv comedy, and playing badminton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode, we talk about Playground, a groundbreaking project that is redefined the way we interact with WordPress. Adam&#8217;s visionary approach to creating a seamless WordPress experience within a web browser has revolutionised how easy it is to access WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Playground&#8217;s history, from the initial frustrations that sparked the idea, to the development process that brought it to life. We gain an understanding of the profound impact Playground is having on the WordPress landscape and its potential to shape the future of web development. It’s not often that the word profound is rightly used, but it feels appropriate here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explore the enormous potential uses of Playground, from simplifying setup processes to enabling experimentation with plugins and themes. Adam&#8217;s vision for Playground as a catalyst for democratising website creation and enabling a culture of innovation within the WordPress community is something that’s still evolving, and it’s clear that the direction the project takes is still being figured out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This project really does change the way that WordPress can be used, and there’s so many exciting prospects for how it might shape the future of website design and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in hearing about cutting-edge advancements reshaping the WordPress landscape, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">WordPress Playground</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a

seems like just yesterday WordPress was <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/05/wordpress-is-a-teenager/\">becoming a teenager</a>, and in a blink of the eye it&#8217;s now old enough to drink! 21 years since <a href=\"https://mikelittle.org/\">Mike</a> and I did the first release of WordPress, forking <a href=\"https://miche.lv/\">Michel&#8217;s</a> work on b2/cafélog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s been many milestones and highlights along the way, and many more to come. I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about elements that made WordPress successful in its early years that we should keep in mind as we build this year and beyond. Here&#8217;s 11 opinions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Simple things should be easy and intuitive, and complex things possible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blogging, commenting, and pingbacks need to be fun. Static websites are fine, but dynamic ones are better. Almost every site would be improved by having a great blog.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wikis are amazing, and our documentation should be wiki-easy to edit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Forums should be front and center in the community. <a href=\"https://bbpress.org/\">bbPress</a> and <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/\">BuddyPress</a> need some love.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Every plugin and theme should have all the infrastructure that we use to build WordPress itself—version control, bug trackers, forums, documentation, internationalization, chat rooms, P2, and easy pathways for contribution and community. We shouldn&#8217;t be uploading ZIPs in 2024!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Theme previews should be great, and a wide collection of non-commercial themes with diverse aesthetics and functionality are crucial. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>We can&#8217;t over-index for guidelines and requirements. Better to have good marketplace dynamics and engineer automated feedback loops and transparency to users. Boundaries in functionality and design should be pushed. (But spam and spammy behavior deserves zero tolerance.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Feedback loops are so important, and should scale with usage and the entire community rather than being reliant on gatekeepers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Core should be opinionated and quirky: Easter eggs, language with personality even if it&#8217;s difficult to translate, jazzy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Everyone developing and making decisions for software needs to use it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It&#8217;s important that we all do support, go to meetups and events, anything we can to stay close to regular end-users of what we make.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>A bonus: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/playground/\">Playground is going to change everything</a>. What would you add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact: On May 27, 2003 I blogged &#8220;Working backwards, earlier tonight was great. Put&nbsp;WordPress&nbsp;out, which felt great.&#8221; as one sentence in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/05/locked-out/\">953-word entry written from the porch of my parent&#8217;s house</a> where I was accidentally locked out all night until my Dad left in the morning to go to work. Had no idea WordPress would be as big as it is. Earlier that night had set up WP for my friend Ramie Speight, and done some phone tech support for another friend Mike Tremoulet I had met through the local blogger meetup. My friends from high school all had their own domains with WP and that feedback loop was magical for shaping the software.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 May 2024 23:50:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 80: Unlocking Your WordPress Potential with Learn WordPress Tools\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=17278\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2024/05/episode-80-unlocking-your-wordpress-potential-with-learn-wordpress-tools/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14791:\"<p>Welcome to another episode of the WordPress Briefing!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28] (Intro Music)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:40] <strong>Josepha:</strong> My friends, I don&#8217;t know about where you live, but where I live, it&#8217;s graduation season. Students all across the region are either gearing down for a little bit of a brain break or gearing up for the next big adventure in their lives. And as I watch these students discover the next phases in their lives, whether it looks good or bad, whether it feels fearful or faithful, I can&#8217;t help but think back to my last big change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:07] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The one that brought me here to WordPress. I was working in insurance at the time and investing in a side hustle. And as is often the case with side hustles, discovered that knowing something about marketing myself was going to be key. Now, this next bit, I know that a lot of you will understand immediately. After that realization, I entered a period in my life where I was learning how to invest in my hoped-for side hustle so that I could realize my hoped-for dreams while also having to succeed at the job that I was using to pay my bills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By some singular coincidence, I wound up being introduced to the WordPress project, where I found not only the tools it turned out I needed but also people who were willing to help me learn them. For me, during that time, the cost to get access to both the tool and that support was basically zero. Like the whole cost to me was get those WordPress people together in a room to talk about WordPress for an hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:04] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that&#8217;s something that I always want to do anyway. I always want to get people together. And if what we&#8217;re talking about is WordPress, and that is what I need to learn about, then so be it. I realize that there is a little bit of privilege in that story and a whole lot of persistence. It&#8217;s not like I discovered it, and overnight, everything worked out well, and perfectly, and correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, all of the struggles to get what I got accomplished done aside. One of the things that I love the most about how the WordPress project has evolved over time is that we took that already low-cost, low-barrier concept and did everything in our power to take that low-cost, low-barrier and make it available to as many people as possible in as many points in their journey as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you&#8217;re at the start of your career or thinking about a bit of a career change, I have some resources for you. Like, stick around. But before we get to the resources, I want to make sure that you hear this. Learning WordPress things, whether that&#8217;s the software itself, or how to run a business supported by WordPress, or how to support other businesses by building them WordPress stuff, learning these skills now is an investment in who you want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:20] <strong>Josepha:</strong> It&#8217;s placing a bet that&#8217;s grounded in what you think you can bring to the world before anyone else might have figured out it&#8217;s what they need in their lives. And when you do that, in WordPress, you&#8217;re accessing and hopefully one day contributing to an equitable framework that doesn&#8217;t require you to understand it in order for you to benefit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can do hard things, and hopefully, these resources make those hard things a little easier. I&#8217;m going to take us through a whirlwind wayfinding list. I&#8217;ll generally be focused on time required and then kind of like necessary actions or context that would be useful for you to know. But remember that your mileage may vary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> If something sounds close but not perfect, I encourage you to give it a try anyway. The worst that happens is you try something different next time. Or, in the best-case scenario, you create something that other folks also have been missing. There was something that was close for them but not perfect either, and maybe you found the thing that&#8217;s perfect for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, here is my whirlwind wayfinding list. Let&#8217;s go. Only have one hour a week and prefer a little company in your learning? Check out a meetup event near you. You can find those listed in your dashboard or on events.WordPress.org, but frequently, they happen during the week, after work hours, sometimes they happen on the weekend, they happen like in libraries or coffee shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there are a lot of different ways that these events come together, and surely, there will be something that is the sort of low-key event that you want. But if not, you can always reach out to your local chapter and see how you can get involved with that, how you can help them create a new meetup event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:02] <strong>Josepha:</strong> The next option, if you only have an hour a week, but you actually don&#8217;t want company but still use some external support, I would check out one of our online workshops. There are cohorts for each workshop, and they&#8217;re run by facilitators so that you can learn and socialize from the comfort and safety of your own space, or if you really are super strapped for time, that can help with like not having to commute anywhere. Next up on our list, feel like you could average an hour a week, but honestly, would prefer it to be in one big chunk? Check out a WordCamp near you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are a little bit like the meetups but quite a bit bigger and a lot more content, a lot more learning available, and gets you into a different kind of group of people in your local area. Those happen about once a year per city or region, but if there&#8217;s not one within a comfortable traveling distance for you, it might be a good chance for you to do a mini business trip, or if you&#8217;re doing it as current career development, see if your boss, or your boss self, if you are your own boss, has a continuing education budget available for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:08] <strong>Josepha:</strong> Have 30 minutes or so a week and don&#8217;t need any external motivation? On the one hand, I am a little jealous. I sometimes need my own external motivation. But, if that&#8217;s not you, if you can just self-drive forever, then courses over on learn.WordPress.org are just about your speed. We even have a series of learning pathways in development that curate all the courses you need to achieve particular milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also help to create those. If you have been all the way through your learning journey and you&#8217;re, like, the most WordPressy WordPresser we&#8217;ve ever seen, and you just want to make sure that other people have the same opportunities you&#8217;ve had, that&#8217;s an excellent opportunity to show up and make sure that the knowledge is still available, still free, still can be accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you have unpredictable time and also still comfortable being completely self-driven, We have in the WordPress ecosystem countless videos, blogs, tutorials, and a ton of content creators that are behind them that specialize in teaching WordPress basics but also leveling up existing knowledge. And if your type of existing knowledge is in the, like, gathering the network to succeed, sort of area. We even have podcasts and blogs that are dedicated to the more businessy side of WordPress, how to make this function in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:32] <strong>Josepha:</strong> As always, I&#8217;ll have links for everything in the show notes—just myriad links because this isn&#8217;t even all that we need to share with you today. And I&#8217;m going to say this last thing one more time because I really, really mean it like a whole, whole lot. I know it&#8217;s hard, bordering on impossible sometimes, to carve out time to learn new things. But when you&#8217;re ready to invest in yourself, I&#8217;m pretty sure that these resources will be here to support your hoped-for dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:58] (Music interlude)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that brings us now to our small list of big things. First up is speaking of learning, speaking of investing in your future. WordCamp Europe has a youth and teen workshop going on. The registration for that is still open. It is open for students aged 10 to 16. It&#8217;s gonna be a hands-on workshop. They&#8217;ll get to build their own website with WordPress and then explore some cutting-edge technology from VR to AI and learn essential internet safety skills. We&#8217;re going to be running that on June 13th. It will be in both English and Italian. I will leave a link to the registration in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the next thing on our list is pretty much related. It&#8217;s kind of related. At WordCamp US this year, we have a Showcase Day. Now, this is new to WordCamp US, and it&#8217;s all about pushing the boundaries of what WordPress can do. It will feature presentations, demos, and technical workshops for all kinds of projects, from high-profile, large-scale builds with innovative integrations to more niche creative implementations that still have a big impact. Submissions are now open for it. If you are working on something that is really cool and uses WordPress and want to show it off to the WordPress community, wander over there, submit your project; let&#8217;s take a look at it and see if we can get it into that showcase lineup, but if you are looking for inspiration about what WordPress can do, if you&#8217;re still figuring out how this can work the best for you, that&#8217;s going to be a great opportunity to look at some unusual implementations so that you can get an idea for how big this thing can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:43] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And just some tactical things. The next two things on my small of big things are two tactical items. One is that WordPress 6.6 is on the move; as always, we have Beta 1 scheduled pretty soon here. So, dig into our priority features. I will leave a link to the roadmap for WordPress 6.6. We&#8217;re targeting, if I recall correctly, middle of July for that release. And so it&#8217;s coming up faster than you think. And we would absolutely love for you to come in, test the Beta, tell us what&#8217;s broken so that we can fix it before it gets out. We can&#8217;t fix the things if you don&#8217;t tell us they&#8217;re broken. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:17] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And then the final thing on our small list of big things is that speaking of not being able to fix things that we don&#8217;t know are broken. So, we use meetup.com to manage all of our meetup series. Well, most of our meetup series anyway, but they are planning to invest in some product improvements, and they have asked for feedback from the WordPress community. Historically, we are one of the largest, most active communities on their platform. And so, if you could fill out the feedback form, if you&#8217;ve been to a meetup, or if you tried to find a meetup using meetup.com and did not succeed, that&#8217;s probably also relevant information. I&#8217;ll have a link to that here as well. It will go directly to their product team. And hopefully we&#8217;ll see some product improvements for the WordPress community in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:01] <strong>Josepha:</strong> And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Don&#8217;t forget to follow us, follow me on your favorite podcast app, or subscribe directly on WordPress.org/news. You&#8217;ll get a friendly reminder whenever there&#8217;s a new episode, and if you liked what you heard today, share it with a fellow WordPresser. Or, if you had questions about what you heard, you can share those with me at WPBriefing@WordPress.org. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks again, and I&#8217;ll see you in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:29] (Music outro)&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 May 2024 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 17:49:12 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 25 Jun 2024 17:30:28 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:7:\"alt-svc\";s:19:\"h3=\":443\"; ma=86400\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}','no');
